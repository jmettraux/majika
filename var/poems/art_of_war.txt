 laying plans
the art of war is of vital importance to the state
it is a matter of life and death,
a road either to safety or to ruin.
hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected
the art of war, then,
is governed by five constant factors,
to be taken into account in one’s deliberations,
when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field
these are:
1) the moral law;
2) heaven;
3) earth;
4) the commander;
5) method and discipline
the moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler,
so
that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
undismayed by any danger
heaven signifies night and day,
cold and heat, times and seasons
earth comprises distances,
great and small;
danger and security;
open ground and narrow passes;
the chances of life and death
the commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,
sincerity, benevolence,
courage and strictness
by method
and discipline are to be understood the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
the gradations of rank among the officers,
the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army,
and the control of military expenditure
these five heads should be familiar to every general:
he who knows them will be victorious;
he who knows them not will fail
therefore, in your deliberations,
when seeking to determine the military conditions,
let them be made the basis of a comparison,
in this wise:
—
which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law
on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced
which army is the stronger
on which side are officers
and men more highly trained
in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward
and punishment
by means of these seven considerations i can forecast victory or defeat
the general that hearkens to my counsel
and acts upon it,
will conquer:
—let such a one be retained in command!
the general
that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,
will suffer defeat:
—let such a one be dismissed
while heeding the profit of my counsel,
avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over
and beyond the ordinary rules
according as circumstances are favourable,
one should modify one’s plans
all warfare is based on deception
hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable;
when using our forces,
we must seem inactive;
when we are near,
we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
when far away,
we must make him believe we are near
hold out baits to entice the enemy.
feign disorder, and crush him
if he is secure at all points,
be prepared for him.
if he is in superior strength, evade him
if your opponent is of choleric temper,
seek to irritate him.
pretend to be weak,
that he may grow arrogant
if he is taking his ease, give him no rest
if his forces are united, separate them
attack him where he is unprepared,
appear where you are not expected
these military devices,
leading to victory,
must not be divulged beforehand
now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought
the general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
thus do many calculations lead to victory,
and few calculations to defeat:
how much more no calculation at all!
it is by attention to this point
that i can foresee who is likely to win or lose
waging war
in the operations of war,
where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots,
as many heavy chariots,
and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers
with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li
the expenditure at home and at the front,
including entertainment of guests,
small items such as glue and paint,
and sums spent on chariots and armour,
will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day.
such is the cost of raising an army of 100,
000 men
when you engage in actual fighting,
if victory is long in coming,
the men’s weapons will grow dull
and their ardour will be damped.
if you lay siege to a town,
you will exhaust your strength
again, if the campaign is protracted,
the resources of the state will not be equal to the strain
now, when your weapons are dulled,
your ardour damped,
your strength exhausted
and your treasure spent,
other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity.
then no man, however wise,
will be able to avert the consequences
that must ensue
thus,
though we have heard of stupid haste in war,
cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays
there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare
it is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war
that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on
the skilful soldier does not raise a second levy,
neither are his supply-waggons loaded more than twice
bring war material with you from home,
but forage on the enemy.
thus the army will have food enough for its needs
poverty of the state exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance.
contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished
on the other hand,
the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;
and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away
when their substance is drained away,
the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions
13, 14.
with this loss of substance
and exhaustion of strength,
the homes of the people will be stripped bare,
and three-tenths of their incomes will be dissipated
while government expenses for broken chariots,
worn-out horses,
breast-plates and helmets,
bows and arrows, spears and shields,
protective mantlets,
draught-oxen and heavy waggons,
will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue
hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.
one cartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own,
and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store
now in order to kill the enemy,
our men must be roused to anger;
that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy,
they must have their rewards
therefore in chariot fighting,
when ten or more chariots have been taken,
those should be rewarded who took the first.
our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy,
and the chariots mingled
and used in conjunction with ours.
the captured soldiers should be kindly treated
and kept
this is called,
using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength
in war, then,
let your great object be victory,
not lengthy campaigns
thus it may be known
that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate,
the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril
attack by stratagem
in the practical art of war,
the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole
and intact;
to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
so, too,
it is better to capture an army entire than to destroy it,
to capture a regiment,
a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them
hence to fight
and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence;
supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting
thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans
the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces
the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field
and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities
the rule is,
not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided
the preparation of mantlets,
movable shelters,
and various implements of war,
will take up three whole months
and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more
the general,
unable to control his irritation,
will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants
with the result
that one-third of his men are slain,
while the town still remains untaken.
such are the disastrous effects of a siege
therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting;
he captures their cities without laying siege to them;
he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field
with his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the empire,
and thus, without losing a man,
his triumph will be complete
this is the method of attacking by stratagem
it is the rule in war,
if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one,
to surround him;
if five to one, to attack him
if twice as numerous,
to divide our army into two
if equally matched, we can offer battle
if slightly inferior in numbers,
we can avoid the enemy
if quite unequal in every way,
we can flee from him
hence,
though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force,
in the end it must be captured by the larger force
now the general is the bulwark of the state:
if the bulwark is complete at all points;
the state will be strong;
if the bulwark is defective,
the state will be weak
there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army
1) by commanding the army to advance or to retreat,
being ignorant of the fact
that it cannot obey.
this is called hobbling the army
2) by attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom,
being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
this causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds
3) by employing the officers of his army without discrimination
through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
this shakes the confidence of the soldiers
but when the army is restless
and distrustful,
trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
this is simply bringing anarchy into the army,
and flinging victory away
thus we may know
that there are five essentials for victory:
1) he will win who knows when to fight
and when not to fight
he will win who knows how to handle both superior
and inferior forces
he will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks
he will win who, prepared himself,
waits to take the enemy unprepared
he will win who has military capacity
and is not interfered with by the sovereign
victory lies in the knowledge of these five points
hence the saying:
if you know the enemy and know yourself,
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
if you know yourself but not the enemy,
for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
if you know neither the enemy nor yourself,
you will succumb in every battle
tactical dispositions
the good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat,
and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy
to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands,
but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself
thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat
but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy
hence the saying:
one may know how to conquer without being able to do it
security against defeat implies defensive tactics;
ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive
standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;
attacking, a superabundance of strength
the general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth
he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven
thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves;
on the other, a victory that is complete
to see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence
neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight
and conquer and the whole empire says,
"well done!
"
"the world’s coarse thumb
and finger fail to plumb.
"
to lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength
to see sun
and moon is no sign of sharp sight;
to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear
what the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,
but excels in winning with ease
hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage
he wins his battles by making no mistakes
making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory,
for it means conquering an enemy
that is already defeated
hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible,
and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy
thus it is
that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won,
whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights
and afterwards looks for victory
the consummate leader cultivates the moral law,
and strictly adheres to method
and discipline;
thus it is in his power to control success
in respect of military method, we have,
firstly, measurement;
secondly, estimation of quantity;
thirdly, calculation;
fourthly, balancing of chances;
fifthly, victory
measurement owes its existence to earth;
estimation of quantity to measurement;
calculation to estimation of quantity;
balancing of chances to calculation;
and victory to balancing of chances
a victorious army opposed to a routed one,
is as a pound’s weight placed in the scale against a single grain
the onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
so much for tactical dispositions
energy
the control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men:
it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers
fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one:
it is merely a question of instituting signs
and signals
to ensure
that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack
and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct
and indirect
that the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points
and strong
in all fighting,
the direct method may be used for joining battle,
but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory
indirect tactics, efficiently applied,
are inexhausible as heaven and earth,
unending as the flow of rivers
and streams;
like the sun and moon,
they end but to begin anew;
like the four seasons,
they pass away but to return once more
there are not more than five musical notes,
yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard
there are not more than five primary colours (blue,
yellow, red, white, and black),
yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen
9 there are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour,
acrid, salt, sweet, bitter),
yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted
in battle,
there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct
and the indirect;
yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of manœuvers
the direct
and the indirect lead on to each other in turn.
it is like moving in a circle—you never come to an end.
who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination
the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course
the quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike
and destroy its victim
therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset,
and prompt in his decision
energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
decision, to the releasing of the trigger
amid the turmoil and tumult of battle,
there may be seeming disorder
and yet no real disorder at all;
amid confusion and chaos,
your array may be without head or tail,
yet it will be proof against defeat
simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline;
simulated fear postulates courage;
simulated weakness postulates strength
hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision
concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy
masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions
thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances,
according to which the enemy will act
he sacrifices something,
that the enemy may snatch at it
by holding out baits,
he keeps him on the march;
then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him
the clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy,
and does not require too much from individuals
hence his ability to pick out the right men
and utilise combined energy
when he utilises combined energy,
his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones.
for it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground,
and to move when on a slope;
if four-cornered, to come to a standstill,
but if round-shaped, to go rolling down
thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height.
so much on the subject of energy
weak points and strong
whoever is first in the field
and awaits the coming of the enemy,
will be fresh for the fight;
whoever is second in the field
and has to hasten to battle,
will arrive exhausted
therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy,
but does not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him
by holding out advantages to him,
he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord;
or, by inflicting damage,
he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near
if the enemy is taking his ease,
he can harass him
if well supplied with food,
he can starve him out;
if quietly encamped,
he can force him to move
appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend;
march swiftly to places where you are not expected
an army may march great distances without distress,
if it marches through country where the enemy is not
you can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended
you can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions
that cannot be attacked
hence
that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend;
and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack
o divine art of subtlety and secrecy!
through you we learn to be invisible,
through you inaudible
and hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands
you may advance
and be absolutely irresistible,
if you make for the enemy’s weak points;
you may retire
and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy
if we wish to fight,
the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart
and a deep ditch.
all we need do is attack some other place
that he will be obliged to relieve
if we do not wish to fight,
we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
all we need do is to throw something odd
and unaccountable in his way
by discovering the enemy’s dispositions
and remaining invisible ourselves,
we can keep our forces concentrated,
while the enemy’s must be divided
we can form a single united body,
while the enemy must split up into fractions.
hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole,
which means
that we shall be many to the enemy’s few
and if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one,
our opponents will be in dire straits
the spot where we intend to fight must not be made known;
for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points
and his forces being thus distributed in many directions,
the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few
for should the enemy strengthen his van,
he will weaken his rear;
should he strengthen his rear,
he will weaken his van;
should he strengthen his left,
he will weaken his right;
should he strengthen his right,
he will weaken his left.
if he sends reinforcements everywhere,
he will everywhere be weak
numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks;
numerical strength,
from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us
knowing the place
and the time of the coming battle,
we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight
but if neither time nor place be known,
then the left wing will be impotent to succour the right,
the right equally impotent to succour the left,
the van unable to relieve the rear,
or the rear to support the van.
how much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart,
and even the nearest are separated by several li
though according to my estimate the soldiers of yüeh exceed our own in number,
that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
i say then that victory can be achieved
though the enemy be stronger in numbers,
we may prevent him from fighting.
scheme so as to discover his plans
and the likelihood of their success
rouse him,
and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity
force him to reveal himself,
so as to find out his vulnerable spots
carefully compare the opposing army with your own,
so
that you may know where strength is superabundant
and where it is deficient
in making tactical dispositions,
the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them
conceal your dispositions,
and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies,
from the machinations of the wisest brains
how victory may be produced for them out of the enemy’s own tactics—
that is what the multitude cannot comprehend
all men can see the tactics whereby i conquer,
but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved
do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory,
but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances
military tactics are like unto water;
for water in its natural course runs away from high places
and hastens downwards
so in war,
the way is to avoid what is strong
and to strike at what is weak
water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows;
the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing
therefore,
just as water retains no constant shape,
so in warfare there are no constant conditions
he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent
and thereby succeed in winning,
may be called a heaven-born captain
the five elements (water, fire, wood,
metal,
earth) are not always equally predominant
the four seasons make way for each other in turn
there are short days and long;
the moon has its periods of waning
and waxing
manœuvering
in war,
the general receives his commands from the sovereign
having collected an army
and concentrated his forces,
he must blend
and harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp
after that, comes tactical manœuvering,
than which there is nothing more difficult
the difficulty of tactical manœuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct,
and misfortune into gain
thus, to take a long
and circuitous route,
after enticing the enemy out of the way,
and though starting after him,
to contrive to reach the goal before him,
shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation
manœuvering with an army is advantageous;
with an undisciplined multitude,
most dangerous
if you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage,
the chances are
that you will be too late.
on the other hand,
to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage
and stores
thus,
if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats,
and make forced marches without halting day or night,
covering double the usual distance at a stretch
doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage,
the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy
the stronger men will be in front,
the jaded ones will fall behind,
and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination
if you march fifty li in order to outmanœuver the enemy,
you will lose the leader of your first division,
and only half your force will reach the goal
if you march thirty li with the same object,
two-thirds of your army will arrive
we may take it then
that an army without its baggage-train is lost;
without provisions it is lost;
without bases of supply it is lost
we cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbours
we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains
and forests,
its pitfalls and precipices,
its marshes and swamps
we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides
in war, practise dissimulation,
and you will succeed
move only if there is a real advantage to be gained
whether to concentrate or to divide your troops,
must be decided by circumstances
let your rapidity be that of the wind
your compactness that of the forest
in raiding and plundering be like fire
in immovability like a mountain
let your plans be dark
and impenetrable as night,
and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt
when you plunder a countryside,
let the spoil be divided amongst your men
when you capture new territory,
cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery
ponder
and deliberate before you make a move
he will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation
such is the art of manœuvering
the book of army management says
on the field of battle
the spoken word does not carry far enough:
hence the institution of gongs and drums.
nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough:
hence the institution of banners
and flags
gongs and drums, banners and flags,
are means whereby the ears
and eyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point
the host thus forming a single united body,
is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone,
or for the cowardly to retreat alone
this is the art of handling large masses of men
in night-fighting, then,
make much use of signal-fires and drums,
and in fighting by day,
of flags and banners,
as a means of influencing the ears
and eyes of your army
a whole army may be robbed of its spirit
a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind
now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning
by noonday it has begun to flag;
and in the evening,
his mind is bent only on returning to camp
a clever general, therefore,
avoids an army when its spirit is keen,
but attacks it when it is sluggish
and inclined to return.
this is the art of studying moods
disciplined and calm,
to await the appearance of disorder
and hubbub amongst the enemy:
—this is the art of retaining self-possession
to be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it,
to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling
and struggling,
to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:
—this is the art of husbanding one’s strength
to refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order,
to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm
and confident array:
—this is the art of studying circumstances
it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy,
nor to oppose him when he comes downhill
do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight;
do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen
do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy
do not interfere with an army
that is returning home
when you surround an army,
leave an outlet free
do not press a desperate foe too hard
such is the art of warfare
variation of tactics
in war,
the general receives his commands from the sovereign,
collects his army
and concentrates his forces
when in difficult country, do not encamp.
in country where high roads intersect,
join hands with your allies.
do not linger in dangerously isolated positions
in hemmed-in situations,
you must resort to stratagem.
in a desperate position, you must fight
there are roads which must not be followed
armies which must be not attacked
towns which must not be besieged
positions which must not be contested,
commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed
the general who thoroughly understands the advantages
that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops
the general who does not understand these,
may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country,
yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account
so,
the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans,
even though he be acquainted with the five advantages,
will fail to make the best use of his men
hence in the wise leader’s plans,
considerations of advantage
and of disadvantage will be blended together
if our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way,
we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes
if, on the other hand,
in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage,
we may extricate ourselves from misfortune
reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them
and make trouble for them
and keep them constantly engaged
hold out specious allurements,
and make them rush to any given point
the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming,
but on our own readiness to receive him;
not on the chance of his not attacking,
but rather on the fact
that we have made our position unassailable
there are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:
1) recklessness,
which leads to destruction
cowardice, which leads to capture
a hasty temper,
which can be provoked by insults
a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame
over-solicitude for his men,
which exposes him to worry and trouble
these are the five besetting sins of a general,
ruinous to the conduct of war
when an army is overthrown
and its leader slain,
the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.
let them be a subject of meditation
the army on the march
we come now to the question of encamping the army,
and observing signs of the enemy.
pass quickly over mountains,
and keep in the neighbourhood of valleys
camp in high places
facing the sun
do not climb heights in order to fight.
so much for mountain warfare
after crossing a river,
you should get far away from it
when an invading force crosses a river in its onward march,
do not advance to meet it in mid-stream.
it will be best to let half the army get across,
and then deliver your attack
if you are anxious to fight,
you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross
moor your craft higher up than the enemy,
and facing the sun
do not move up-stream to meet the enemy
so much for river warfare
in crossing salt-marshes,
your sole concern should be to get over them quickly,
without any delay
if forced to fight in a salt-marsh,
you should have water and grass near you,
and get your back to a clump of trees
so much for operations in salt-marshes
in dry, level country,
take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right
and on your rear
so that the danger may be in front,
and safety lie behind.
so much for campaigning in flat country
these are the four useful branches of military knowledge
which enabled the yellow emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns
all armies prefer high ground to low
and sunny places to dark
if you are careful of your men
and camp on hard ground,
the army will be free from disease of every kind
and this will spell victory
when you come to a hill or a bank,
occupy the sunny side,
with the slope on your right rear.
thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers
and utilise the natural advantages of the ground
when,
in consequence of heavy rains up-country,
a river which you wish to ford is swollen
and flecked with foam,
you must wait until it subsides
country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between,
deep natural hollows
confined places, tangled thickets
quagmires and crevasses
should be left with all possible speed
and not approached
while we keep away from such places,
we should get the enemy to approach them;
while we face them,
we should let the enemy have them on his rear
if in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly country,
ponds surrounded by aquatic grass,
hollow basins filled with reeds,
or woods with thick undergrowth,
they must be carefully routed out
and searched;
for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking
when the enemy is close at hand
and remains quiet,
he is relying on the natural strength of his position
when he keeps aloof
and tries to provoke a battle,
he is anxious for the other side to advance
if his place of encampment is easy of access,
he is tendering a bait
movement amongst the trees of a forest shows
that the enemy is advancing
the appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means
that the enemy wants to make us suspicious
the rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade
startled beasts indicate
that a sudden attack is coming
when there is dust rising in a high column,
it is the sign of chariots advancing;
when the dust is low,
but spread over a wide area,
it betokens the approach of infantry
when it branches out in different directions,
it shows
that parties have been sent to collect firewood.
a few clouds of dust moving to
and fro signify
that the army is encamping
humble words
and increased preparations are signs
that the enemy is about to advance
violent language
and driving forward as if to the attack are signs
that he will retreat
when the light chariots come out first
and take up a position on the wings,
it is a sign
that the enemy is forming for battle
peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot
when there is much running about
and the soldiers fall into rank,
it means
that the critical moment has come
when some are seen advancing
and some retreating,
it is a lure
when the soldiers stand leaning on their spears,
they are faint from want of food
if those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,
the army is suffering from thirst
if the enemy sees an advantage to be gained
and makes no effort to secure it,
the soldiers are exhausted
if birds gather on any spot,
it is unoccupied
clamour by night betokens nervousness
if there is disturbance in the camp,
the general’s authority is weak.
if the banners
and flags are shifted about,
sedition is afoot.
if the officers are angry,
it means that the men are weary
when an army feeds its horses with grain
and kills its cattle for food
and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,
showing
that they will not return to their tents,
you may know
that they are determined to fight to the death
the sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank
and file
too frequent rewards signify
that the enemy is at the end of his resources
too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress
to begin by bluster,
but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s numbers,
shows a supreme lack of intelligence
when envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths,
it is a sign
that the enemy wishes for a truce
if the enemy’s troops march up angrily
and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,
the situation is one
that demands great vigilance
and circumspection
if our troops are no more in number than the enemy,
that is amply sufficient;
it only means
that no direct attack can be made
what we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,
keep a close watch on the enemy,
and obtain reinforcements
he who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them
if soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,
they will not prove submissive;
and, unless submissive,
then will be practically useless.
if,
when the soldiers have become attached to you,
punishments are not enforced,
they will still be useless
therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity,
but kept under control by means of iron discipline
this is a certain road to victory
if in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced,
the army will be well-disciplined;
if not, its discipline will be bad
if a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed
the gain will be mutual
terrain
we may distinguish six kinds of terrain,
to wit:
1) accessible ground
entangling ground
temporising ground
narrow passes;
5) precipitous heights;
6) positions at a great distance from the enemy
ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible
with regard to ground of this nature,
be before the enemy in occupying the raised
and sunny spots,
and carefully guard your line of supplies
then you will be able to fight with advantage
ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling
from a position of this sort,
if the enemy is unprepared,
you may sally forth and defeat him.
but if the enemy is prepared for your coming,
and you fail to defeat him, then,
return being impossible,
disaster will ensue
when the position is such
that neither side will gain by making the first move,
it is called temporising ground
in a position of this sort,
even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait
it will be advisable not to stir forth,
but rather to retreat,
thus enticing the enemy in his turn;
then, when part of his army has come out,
we may deliver our attack with advantage
with regard to narrow passes,
if you can occupy them first,
let them be strongly garrisoned
and await the advent of the enemy
should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass,
do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned,
but only if it is weakly garrisoned
with regard to precipitous heights,
if you are beforehand with your adversary,
you should occupy the raised
and sunny spots,
and there wait for him to come up
if the enemy has occupied them before you,
do not follow him,
but retreat and try to entice him away
if you are situated at a great distance from the enemy,
and the strength of the two armies is equal,
it is not easy to provoke a battle
and fighting will be to your disadvantage
these six are the principles connected with earth
the general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them
now an army is exposed to six several calamities,
not arising from natural causes,
but from faults for which the general is responsible.
these are:
1) flight;
2) insubordination;
3) collapse;
4) ruin;
5) disorganisation;
6) rout
other conditions being equal,
if one force is hurled against another ten times its size,
the result will be the flight of the former
when the common soldiers are too strong
and their officers too weak,
the result is insubordination
when the officers are too strong
and the common soldiers too weak,
the result is collapse
when the higher officers are angry
and insubordinate,
and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment,
before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight,
the result is ruin
when the general is weak
and without authority;
when his orders are not clear
and distinct
when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers
and men
and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner,
the result is utter disorganisation
when a general,
unable to estimate the enemy’s strength,
allows an inferior force to engage a larger one,
or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one,
and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank,
the result must be a rout
these are six ways of courting defeat,
which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post
the natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally
but a power of estimating the adversary,
of controlling the forces of victory,
and of shrewdly calculating difficulties,
dangers and distances,
constitutes the test of a great general
he who knows these things,
and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice,
will win his battles.
he who knows them not, nor practises them,
will surely be defeated
if fighting is sure to result in victory,
then you must fight,
even though the ruler forbid it;
if fighting will not result in victory,
then you must not fight even at the ruler’s bidding
the general who advances without coveting fame
and retreats without fearing disgrace
whose only thought is to protect his country
and do good service for his sovereign,
is the jewel of the kingdom
regard your soldiers as your children,
and they will follow you into the deepest valleys;
look on them as your own beloved sons,
and they will stand by you even unto death
if, however, you are indulgent,
but unable to make your authority felt;
kind-hearted,
but unable to enforce your commands;
and incapable, moreover,
of quelling disorder:
then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children;
they are useless for any practical purpose
if we know
that our own men are in a condition to attack,
but are unaware
that the enemy is not open to attack,
we have gone only halfway towards victory
if we know
that the enemy is open to attack,
but are unaware
that our own men are not in a condition to attack,
we have gone only halfway towards victory
if we know
that the enemy is open to attack,
and also know
that our men are in a condition to attack,
but are unaware
that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable,
we have still gone only halfway towards victory
hence the experienced soldier,
once in motion, is never bewildered;
once he has broken camp,
he is never at a loss
hence the saying:
if you know the enemy and know yourself,
your victory will not stand in doubt;
if you know heaven and know earth,
you may make your victory complete
the nine situations
the art of war recognises nine varieties of ground:
dispersive ground;
2) facile ground;
3) contentious ground;
4) open ground;
5) ground of intersecting highways;
6) serious ground;
difficult ground;
8) hemmed-in ground;
9) desperate ground
when a chieftain is fighting in his own territory,
it is dispersive ground
when he has penetrated into hostile territory,
but to no great distance,
it is facile ground
ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side,
is contentious ground
ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground
ground which forms the key to three contiguous states
so
that he who occupies it first has most of the empire at his command
is ground of intersecting highways
when an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,
leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear,
it is serious ground
mountain forests
rugged steeps,
marshes
and fens—all country
that is hard to traverse:
this is difficult ground
ground which is reached through narrow gorges,
and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths,
so
that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men:
this is hemmed in ground
ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay,
is desperate ground
on dispersive ground, therefore,
fight not.
on facile ground, halt not.
on contentious ground, attack not
on open ground,
do not try to block the enemy’s way
on ground of intersecting highways,
join hands with your allies
on serious ground, gather in plunder
in difficult ground,
keep steadily on the march
on hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem
on desperate ground, fight
those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy’s front
and rear
to prevent co-operation between his large
and small divisions;
to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad,
the officers from rallying their men
when the enemy’s men were scattered,
they prevented them from concentrating;
even when their forces were united,
they managed to keep them in disorder
when it was to their advantage,
they made a forward move;
when otherwise, they stopped still
if asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array
and on the point of marching to the attack,
i should say:
"begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear;
then he will be amenable to your will.
"
rapidity is the essence of war
take advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness,
make your way by unexpected routes,
and attack unguarded spots
the following are the principles to be observed by an invading force:
the further you penetrate into a country,
the greater will be the solidarity of your troops,
and thus the defenders will not prevail against you
make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food
carefully study the well-being of your men
and do not overtax them.
concentrate your energy
and hoard your strength
keep your army continually on the move
and devise unfathomable plans
throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape,
and they will prefer death to flight.
if they will face death,
there is nothing they may not achieve
officers
and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength
soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear.
if there is no place of refuge,
they will stand firm.
if they are in the heart of a hostile country,
they will show a stubborn front.
if there is no help for it,
they will fight hard
thus, without waiting to be marshalled,
the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive;
without waiting to be asked,
they will do your will
without restrictions,
they will be faithful;
without giving orders, they can be trusted
prohibit the taking of omens,
and do away with superstitious doubts.
then, until death itself comes,
no calamity need be feared
if our soldiers are not overburdened with money,
it is not because they have a distaste for riches;
if their lives are not unduly long,
it is not because they are disinclined to longevity
on the day they are ordered out to battle,
your soldiers may weep
those sitting up bedewing their garments,
and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks
but let them once be brought to bay,
and they will display the courage of a chu or a kuei
the skilful tactician may be likened to the bolt-snake.
now the bolt is a snake
that is found in the ch‘ang mountains
strike at its head,
and you will be attacked by its tail;
strike at its tail,
and you will be attacked by its head;
strike at its middle,
and you will be attacked by head
and tail both
asked if an army can be made to imitate the bolt-snake
i should answer, yes.
for the men of wu
and the men of yüeh are enemies
yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat
and are caught by a storm,
they will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right
hence it is not enough to put one’s trust in the tethering of horses,
and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground
the principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach
how to make the best of both strong
and weak—
that is a question involving the proper use of ground
thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man,
willy-nilly, by the hand
it is the business of a general to be quiet
and thus ensure secrecy;
upright and just, and thus maintain order
he must be able to mystify his officers
and men by false reports and appearances
and thus keep them in total ignorance
by altering his arrangements
and changing his plans
he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge
by shifting his camp
and taking circuitous routes,
he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose
at the critical moment,
the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height
and then kicks away the ladder behind him.
he carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand
he burns his boats
and breaks his cooking-pots;
like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep,
he drives his men this way and that,
and none knows whither he is going
to muster his host
and bring it into danger:
—this may be termed the business of the general
the different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground
the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics;
and the fundamental laws of human nature:
these are things
that must most certainly be studied
when invading hostile territory,
the general principle is,
that penetrating deeply brings cohesion;
penetrating but a short way means dispersion
when you leave your own country behind,
and take your army across neighbourhood territory,
you find yourself on critical ground
when there are means of communication on all four sides,
the ground is one of intersecting highways
when you penetrate deeply into a country,
it is serious ground.
when you penetrate but a little way,
it is facile ground
when you have the enemy’s strongholds on your rear,
and narrow passes in front,
it is hemmed-in ground.
when there is no place of refuge at all,
it is desperate ground
therefore, on dispersive ground,
i would inspire my men with unity of purpose
on facile ground,
i would see
that there is close connection between all parts of my army
on contentious ground,
i would hurry up my rear
on open ground,
i would keep a vigilant eye on my defences.
on ground of intersecting highways,
i would consolidate my alliances
on serious ground,
i would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies
on difficult ground,
i would keep pushing on along the road
on hemmed-in ground,
i would block any way of retreat
on desperate ground,
i would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives
for it is the soldier’s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded,
to fight hard when he cannot help himself,
and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger
we cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are acquainted with their designs.
we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains
and forests,
its pitfalls and precipices,
its marshes and swamps.
we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides
to be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince
when a warlike prince attacks a powerful state,
his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces.
he overawes his opponents,
and their allies are prevented from joining against him
hence he does not strive to ally himself with all
and sundry,
nor does he foster the power of other states.
he carries out his own secret designs,
keeping his antagonists in awe
thus he is able to capture their cities
and overthrow their kingdoms
bestow rewards without regard to rule
issue orders
without regard to previous arrangements
and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man
confront your soldiers with the deed itself;
never let them know your design
when the outlook is bright,
bring it before their eyes;
but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy
place your army in deadly peril,
and it will survive;
plunge it into desperate straits,
and it will come off in safety
for it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm’s way
that is capable of striking a blow for victory
success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy’s purpose
by persistently hanging on the enemy’s flank
we shall succeed in the long run
in killing the commander-in-chief
this is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning
on the day that you take up your command,
block the frontier passes,
destroy the official tallies
and stop the passage of all emissaries
be stern in the council-chamber
so that you may control the situation
if the enemy leaves a door open,
you must rush in
forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear
and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground
walk in the path defined by rule
and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle
at first, then,
exhibit the coyness of a maiden,
until the enemy gives you an opening;
afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare,
and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you
the attack by fire
there are five ways of attacking with fire.
the first is to burn soldiers in their camp
the second is to burn stores
the third is to burn baggage-trains
the fourth is to burn arsenals
and magazines
the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy
in order to carry out an attack,
we must have means available
the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness
there is a proper season for making attacks with fire,
and special days for starting a conflagration
the proper season is when the weather is very dry;
the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the sieve,
the wall, the wing or the cross-bar
for these four are all days of rising wind
in attacking with fire,
one should be prepared to meet five possible developments
1) when fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp,
respond at once with an attack from without
2) if there is an outbreak of fire,
but the enemy’s soldiers remain quiet,
bide your time and do not attack
3) when the force of the flames has reached its height,
follow it up with an attack,
if that is practicable;
if not, stay where you are
4) if it is possible to make an assault with fire from without,
do not wait for it to break out within,
but deliver your attack at a favourable moment
5) when you start a fire,
be to windward of it.
do not attack from the leeward
a wind
that rises in the daytime lasts long,
but a night breeze soon falls
in every army,
the five developments connected with fire must be known,
the movements of the stars calculated,
and a watch kept for the proper days
hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;
those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength
by means of water,
an enemy may be intercepted,
but not robbed of all his belongings
unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles
and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise;
for the result is waste of time
and general stagnation
hence the saying:
the enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;
the good general cultivates his resources
move not unless you see an advantage;
use not your troops unless there is something to be gained;
fight not unless the position is critical
no ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen;
no general should fight a battle simply out of pique
if it is to your advantage,
make a forward move;
if not, stay where you are
anger may in time change to gladness;
vexation may be succeeded by content
but a kingdom
that has once been destroyed can never come again into being
nor can the dead ever be brought back to life
hence the enlightened ruler is heedful,
and the good general full of caution.
this is the way to keep a country at peace
and an army intact
the use of spies
raising a host of a hundred thousand men
and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people
and a drain on the resources of the state.
the daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver
there will be commotion at home
and abroad,
and men will drop down exhausted on the highways
as many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor
hostile armies may face each other for years,
striving for the victory which is decided in a single day.
this being so,
to remain in ignorance of the enemy’s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours
and emoluments
is the height of inhumanity
one who acts thus is no leader of men,
no present help to his sovereign,
no master of victory
thus,
what enables the wise sovereign
and the good general to strike
and conquer,
and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men,
is foreknowledge
now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits;
it cannot be obtained inductively from experience
nor by any deductive calculation
knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions can only be obtained from other men
hence the use of spies,
of whom there are five classes:
1) local spies;
2) inward spies;
3) converted spies;
4) doomed spies;
5) surviving spies
when these five kinds of spy are all at work,
none can discover the secret system.
this is called "divine manipulation of the threads.
it is the sovereign’s most precious faculty
having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district
having inward spies,
making use of officials of the enemy
having converted spies,
getting hold of the enemy’s spies
and using them for our own purposes
having doomed spies,
doing certain things openly for purposes of deception,
and allowing our own spies to know of them
and report them to the enemy
surviving spies, finally,
are those who bring back news from the enemy’s camp
hence it is
that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies
none should be more liberally rewarded.
in no other business should greater secrecy be preserved
spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity
they cannot be properly managed without benevolence
and straightforwardness
without subtle ingenuity of mind,
one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports
be subtle!
be subtle!
and use your spies for every kind of business
if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe,
he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told
whether the object be to crush an army,
to storm a city,
or to assassinate an individual,
it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants,
the aides-de- camp
the door-keepers
and sentries of the general in command.
our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these
the enemy’s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out,
tempted with bribes,
led away and comfortably housed.
thus they will become converted spies
and available for our service
it is through the information brought by the converted spy
that we are able to acquire
and employ local and inward spies
it is owing to his information, again,
that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy
lastly,
it is by his information
that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions
the end
and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy;
and this knowledge can only be derived,
in the first instance,
from the converted spy
hence it is essential
that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality
hence it is only the enlightened ruler
and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying
and thereby they achieve great results
spies are a most important element in war,
because on them depends an army’s ability to move
