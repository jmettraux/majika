
       The Light and Saviour of the chosen people
          Deserving protection,
          He shall have from His beloved assembly
          “A song of Songs.”

       The Graceful One, the object of all longing desires.
          The Reviving Cordial of the fainting heart,
          The Bountiful Source of abundant supply,
          “He hath kissed me with kisses.”

       The loved one above all nations,
          The keeper of the Law Thou hast given,
          Her didst Thou perfume with Thy spices,
          “The odour of Thy sweet ointments.”

       The chosen of Thy house and nobles,
          Lo! we are surrounded with splendour,
          We press to the house of Thy glory,
          “Oh draw us after thee.”

       Oh Thou all majestic, yet mild,
          Thou hast crown’d me with grace above many,
          Though now with grief I am marred,
          “I am swarthy, but comely.”


THE SONG OF SONGS,
#WHICH IS SOLOMON’S.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Oh for a kiss of the kisses of his mouth!
    For sweet are thy caresses above wine.
    Sweet is the odour of thy perfumes,
      Which perfume thou art, by thy name diffused abroad,
    Therefore do the damsels love thee.
    Oh draw me after thee! Oh let us flee together!
    The king has brought me into his apartments,
    But we exult and rejoice in thee,
    We praise thy love more than wine,
    The upright love thee.
    I am swarthy, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
    As the tents of Kedar,
    But comely as the pavilions of Solomon.
    Disdain me not because I am dark,
    For the sun hath browned me.
    My mother’s sons were severe with me,
    They made me keeper of their vineyards,
    Though my own vineyard I never kept.—
    Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
    Where thou feedest thy flock,
    Where thou causest it to lie down at noon,
    Lest I should be roaming
    Among the flocks of thy companions.


    DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM.

    If thou knowest not, O fairest among women,
    Go in the footsteps of the flocks,
    And feed thy kids
    By the tents of the shepherds.


    #SOLOMON.

    To my steed in the chariot of Pharaoh
    Do I compare thee, O my love.
    Beautiful is thy countenance in the circlet,
    Thy neck in the necklace!
    A golden circlet will we make thee,
    With studs of silver.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    While the king is at his table
    My nard shall diffuse its fragrance.
    A bag of myrrh resting in my bosom
    Is my beloved unto me.
    A bunch of cypress-flowers from the garden of En-gedi
    Is my beloved unto me.


    #THE SHEPHERD.

    Behold, thou art beautiful, my love;
    Behold, thou art beautiful,
    Thine eyes are doves.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Behold, thou art comely, my beloved,
    Yea thou art lovely;
    Yea, verdant is our couch;
    Our bower is of cedar arches,
    Our retreat of cypress roof:
    I am a mere flower of the plain,
    A lily of the valley.


    #THE SHEPHERD.

    As a lily among the thorns,
    So is my loved one among the damsels.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    As an apple-tree among the wild trees,
    So is my beloved among the youths.
    I delight to sit beneath its shade,
    For delicious is its fruit to my taste.
    He led me into that bower of delight,
    And overshaded me with love.
    Oh, strengthen me with grape-cakes,
    Refresh me with apples,
    For I am sick with love!
    Let his left hand be under my head,
    And his right hand support me!
    I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
    By the gazelles, or the hinds of the field,
    Neither to excite nor to incite my affection
    Till it wishes another love.


#SECTION II.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Hark! my beloved!
    Lo, he came
    Leaping over the mountains,
    Bounding over the hills.
    My beloved was like a gazelle,
    Or the young one of a hind.
    Lo! there he stood behind our wall,
    He looked through the window,
    He glanced through the lattice.
    My beloved spake, he spake to me,
    “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come!
    For lo, the winter is past,
    The rain is over, is gone.
    The flowers appear upon the fields,
    The time of singing is come,
    The cooing of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.
    The fig-tree sweetens her green figs,
    The vines blossom,
    They diffuse fragrance;
    Arise, my love, my fair one, and come!
    My dove in the clefts of the rock,
    In the hiding-place of the cliff,
    Let me see thy countenance,
    Let me hear thy voice,
    For sweet is thy voice,
    And thy countenance lovely.”


    #THE BROTHERS OF THE SHULAMITE.

    Catch us the foxes, the little foxes
    Which destroy the vineyards,
    For our vineyards are in bloom.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    My beloved is mine, and I am his,
    His who feeds his flock among the lilies.
    When the day cools,
    And the shadows flee away,
    Return, haste, O my beloved,
    Like the gazelle or the young one of the hind,
    Over the mountains of separation.
    When on my nightly couch,
    I still sought him whom my soul loveth;
    I sought him, but found him not.
    I must arise now and go about the city,
    In the streets and in the squares;
    I must seek him whom my soul loveth:
    I sought him, but found him not.
    The watchmen who patrol the city found me:
    “Have you seen him whom my soul loveth?”
    Scarcely had I passed them,
    When I found him whom my soul loveth;
    I seized him and would not let him go
    Till I brought him to the house of my mother,
    Into the apartment of her who gave me birth.
    I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
    By the gazelles or the hinds of the field,
    Neither to excite nor to incite my affection
    Till it wishes another love.

#SECTION III.

    ONE OF THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM.

    What is that coming up from the country,
    As in columns of smoke,
    Perfumed with myrrh, with frankincense,
    And all sorts of aromatics from the merchants?


    ANOTHER.

    Lo! it is the palanquin of Solomon,
    Around it are threescore valiant men
    From the valiant of Israel:
    All skilled in the sword, expert in war,
    Each with his sword girded on his thigh
    Against the nightly marauders.


    A THIRD.

    A palanquin hath king Solomon made for himself,
    Of the wood of Lebanon.
    Its pillars he hath made of silver,
    Its support of gold, its seat of purple,
    Its interior tesselated most lovely
    By the daughters of Jerusalem.


    A FOURTH.

    Come out, ye daughters of Zion,
    And behold King Solomon;
    The crown with which his mother crowned him
    On the day of his espousals,
    On the day of his gladness of heart.


    THE SHEPHERD, ADVANCING TO THE SHULAMITE.

    Behold, thou art beautiful, my loved one,
    Behold, thou art beautiful!
    Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil;
    Thy hair is like a flock of goats,
    Springing down Mount Gilead.
    Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep
    Which come up from the washing-pool,
    All of which are paired,
    And not one among them is bereaved.
    Like a braid of scarlet are thy lips,
    And thy mouth is lovely:
    Like a part of the pomegranate
    Are thy cheeks behind thy veil;
    Thy neck is like the tower of David,
    Reared for the builder’s model:
    A thousand shields are hung upon it,
    All sorts of bucklers of the mighty.
    Thy bosom like two young fawns,
    Twins of a gazelle, feeding among lilies.


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    When the day cools
    And the shadows flee away,
    I will go to the mount of myrrh,
    To the hill of frankincense.


    THE SHEPHERD.

    Thou art all beautiful, my loved one,
    And there is no blemish in thee.
    With me, with me, my betrothed,
    Thou shalt go from Lebanon;
    Thou shalt go from the heights of Amana,
    From the summit of Shenir and Hermon,
    From the habitations of lions,
    From the mountains of panthers.
    Thou hast emboldened me,
    My sister, my betrothed,
    Thou hast emboldened me,
    With one of thine eyes,
    With one of the chains of thy neck.
    How sweet is thy love, O my sister, my betrothed!
    How sweet is thy love above wine!
    And the fragrance of thy perfumes above all the spices!
    Thy lips, O my betrothed, distil honey:
    Honey and milk are under thy tongue,
    And the odour of thy garments is as the smell of Lebanon.
    A closed garden art thou, my sister, my betrothed,
    A closed garden, a sealed fountain.
    Thy shoots like a garden of pomegranates,
    With precious fruits,
    Cypresses and nards,
    Nard and crocus,
    Calamus and cinnamon,
    With all sorts of frankincense trees,
    Myrrh and aloes;
    With all kinds of excellent aromatics,
    With a garden-fountain,
    A well of living waters,
    And streams flowing from Lebanon.
    Arise, O north wind! and come, thou south!
    Blow upon my garden,
    That its perfumes may flow out!


    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Let my beloved come into his garden
    And eat its delicious fruits!


    #THE SHEPHERD.

    I am coming into my garden, my sister, my betrothed:
    I am gathering my myrrh with my spices,
    I am eating my honeycomb with my honey,
    I am drinking my wine with my milk.


    #SOME OF THE DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM.

    Eat, O friends!
    Drink, and drink abundantly, O beloved!

#SECTION IV.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    I was sleeping, but my heart kept awake,
    Hark! my beloved! he is knocking!
    Open to me, my sister, my love!
    My dove, my perfect beauty!
    For my head is filled with dew,
    My locks with the drops of the night.
    I have put off my tunic,
    How shall I put it on?
    I have washed my feet,
    How shall I soil them?
    My beloved withdrew his hand from the door hole,
    And my heart was disquieted within me.
    I immediately arose to open to my beloved,
    And my hands dropped with myrrh,
    And my fingers with liquid myrrh,
    Upon the handles of the bolt.
    I opened to my beloved,
    But my beloved had withdrawn, was gone!
    My soul departed when he spoke of it!
    I sought him, and found him not;
    I called him, and he answered me not.
    The watchmen who patrol the city found me:
    They beat me, they wounded me;
    The keepers of the walls stripped me of my veiling garment.
    I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
    If ye shall find my beloved,
    What will ye tell him?
    Tell him that I am sick of love.

    #DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM.

    What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
    O thou fairest among women?
    What is thy beloved, more than another beloved,
    That thou thus adjurest us?

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    My beloved is white and ruddy,
    Distinguished above thousands;
    His head is as the finest gold,
    His flowing locks are black as the raven.
    His eyes, like doves in water streams,
    Are bathing in milk, sitting on fulness;
    His cheeks are like beds of balsam,
    Elevations of aromatic plants;
    His lips are like lilies distilling liquid myrrh.
    His hands like golden cylinders, inlaid with chrysolite,
    His body is like polished ivory, covered with sapphires.
    His legs are like pillars of marble
    Based upon pedestals of gold.
    His aspect is like that of Lebanon.
    He is distinguished as the cedars.
    His voice is exquisitely sweet;
    Yea, his whole person is exceedingly lovely.
    Such is my beloved, such my friend,
    O daughters of Jerusalem.

    #DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM.

    Whither is thy beloved gone,
    O thou fairest among women?
    Whither is thy beloved turned away?
    Say, that we may seek him with thee.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    My beloved is gone down into his garden,
    To the beds of aromatics,
    To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
    I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine;
    He who feeds his flock among the lilies.

    #SOLOMON.

    Graceful art thou, O my love, as Tirzah,
    Beautiful as Jerusalem,
    Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts!
    Turn away thine eyes from me,
    For they inspire me with awe!
    Thy hair is like a flock of goats
    Springing down Mount Gilead;
    Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep,
    Which come up from the washing-pool;
    All of which are paired,
    And not one among them is bereaved.
    Like a part of the pomegranate
    Are thy cheeks behind thy veil.
    I have threescore queens,
    And fourscore concubines,
    And maidens without number;
    But she is my only one, my dove, my perfect beauty,
    She, the delight of her mother,
    She, the darling of her parent!
    The damsels saw her and praised her;
    The queens also, and the concubines, and extolled her thus:
    “Who is she that looks forth as the morn,
    Beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun,
    Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?”

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    I went down into the nut-garden,
    To look among the green plants by the river,
    To see whether the vine was budding,
    Whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
    Unwittingly had my longing soul brought me
    To the chariots of the companions of the prince.

                                    (She goes away).


    #SOLOMON.

    Return, return, O Shulamite,
    Return, return, that we may look at thee.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    What will you behold in the Shulamite?

    #SOLOMON.

    Like a dance to double choirs.
    How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O noble maiden!
    The circuits of thy thighs like ornaments,
    The work of a master’s hands.
    Thy navel is like a round goblet,
    Let not spiced wine be wanted in it;
    Thy body is like a heap of wheat,
    Hedged round with lilies.
    Thy bosom is like two young fawns,
    Twins of a gazelle.
    Thy neck is like an ivory tower;
    Thine eyes are as the pools in Heshbon,
    By the populous gate;
    Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon,
    Looking towards Damascus.
    Thy head upon thee as purple,
    And the tresses of thy head as crimson.
    The king is captivated by the ringlets:
    How beautiful and how charming,
    O love, in thy fascinations!
    This thy growth is like a palm-tree,
    And thy bosom like its clusters.
    I long to climb this palm-tree,
    I long to clasp its branches.
    May thy bosom be unto me
    As the clusters of the vine,
    And the odour of thy breath
    As that of apples;
    And thy speech as delicious wine,
    Which to my friend flows down with mellowed sweetness,
    And causes slumbering lips to speak.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    I belong to my beloved,
    And it is for me to desire him.
    Come, my beloved, let us go into the country,
    Let us abide in the villages.
    We will go early to the vineyards,
    We will see whether the vine flourishes;
    Whether the buds open;
    Whether the pomegranates blossom;
    There will I give thee my love.
    The mandrakes diffuse fragrance,
    And at our door are all sorts of delicious fruit,
    Both new and old;
    I have reserved them, O my beloved, for thee!
    Chap. VIII. Oh that thou wert as my brother,
    As one who had been nourished in the bosom of my mother!
    If I found thee in the street I would kiss thee,
    And should no more be reproached.
    I would lead thee thence,
    I would bring thee into the house of my mother;
    Thou shouldst be my teacher,
    I would cause thee to drink
    Of the aromatic wine,
    Of my pomegranate juice.
    Let his left hand be under my head,
    And his right hand support me!
    I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
    Neither to incite nor to excite my affection
    Till it desires another love.

#SECTION V.

    THE COMPANIONS OF THE SHEPHERD.

    Who is it that comes up from the plain,
    Leaning upon her beloved?

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Under this apple-tree I won thy heart,
    Here thy mother travailed,
    Here labouring she gave thee birth.
    Oh, place me as a seal upon thy heart,
    As a seal upon thine hand!
    For love is strong as death,
    Affection as inexorable as Hades.
    Its flames are flames of fire,
    The flames of the Eternal.
    Floods cannot quench love;
    Streams cannot sweep it away.
    If one should offer all his wealth for love,
    He would be utterly despised.

    #ONE OF THE BROTHERS OF THE SHULAMITE.

    Our sister is still young,
    And is not yet marriageable.
    What shall we do for our sister,
    When she shall be demanded in marriage?

    ANOTHER BROTHER.

    If she be like a wall,
    We will build upon her a silver turret.
    But if she be like a door,
    We will enclose her with boards of cedar.

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    I am like a wall,
    And my bosom is as towers!
    Then I was in his eyes
    As one that findeth favour.
    Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hammon;
    He let out the vineyard to tenants;
    Each of whom yielded for the fruit of it
    A thousand shekels of silver.
    I will keep my own vineyard:
    Be the thousands thine, O Solomon,
    And the two hundreds to the keepers of its fruit!

    #THE SHEPHERD.

    O thou that dwellest in the gardens,
    My companions are listening to thy voice,
    Let me hear thy voice!

    #THE SHULAMITE.

    Haste, O my beloved,
    And be like the gazelle, as the young one of the hind,
    Over the mountains of spices.
