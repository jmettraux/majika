tell me the truths which you hear of our constant young lady,
and may the bought yoke of a mistress lie with equitable weight
on your shoulders;
for i am swelled up with inane pleasurabilities
and deceived by your reference to things which you think i would like to believe
no messenger should come wholly empty,
and a slave should fear plausibilities;
much conversation is as good as having a home.
out with it, tell it to me, all of it,
from the beginning,
i guzzle with outstretched ears.

she wept into uncombed hair,
and you saw it,
vast waters flowed from her eyes?
you,
you lygdamus saw her stretched on her bed,
it was no glimpse in a mirror;
no gawds on her snowy hands,
no orfevrerie,
sad garment draped on her slender arms.
her escritoires lay shut by the bed-feet.
sadness hung over the house,
and the desolated female attendants were desolated
because she had told them her dreams
she was veiled in the midst of
that place,
damp wooly handkerchiefs were stuffed into her undryable eyes,
and a querulous noise responded to our solicitous reprobations
for which things you will get a reward from me,
lygdamus?
to say many things is equal to having a home
and the other woman “has not enticed me by her pretty manners,
she has caught me with herbaceous poison,
she twiddles the spiked wheel of a rhombus,
she stews puffed frogs, snake’s bones,
the moulded feathers of screech owls
she binds me with ravvles of shrouds.
black spiders spin in her bed!
let her lovers snore at her in the morning!
may the gout cramp up her feet!
does he like me to sleep here alone,
lygdamus?
will he say nasty things at my funeral?
and you expect me to believe this after twelve months of discomfort
now if ever it is time to cleanse helicon;
to lead emathian horses afield,
and to name over the census of my chiefs in the roman camp.
if i have not the faculty,
the bare attempt would be praise-worthy.
in things of similar magnitude the mere will to act is sufficient.
the primitive ages sang venus,
the last sings of a tumult,
and i also will sing war when this matter of a girl is exhausted

if any land shrink into a distant seacoast,
it is a mere postponement of your domination,
and i shall follow the camp,
i shall be duly celebrated,
for singing the affairs of your cavalry.
may the fates watch over my day
yet you ask on what account i write so many love-lyrics
and whence this soft book comes into my mouth.
neither calliope nor apollo sung these things into my ear,
my genius is no more than a girl
if she with ivory fingers drive a tune through the lyre,
we look at the process how easy the moving fingers;
if hair is mussed on her forehead,
if she goes in a gleam of cos,
in a slither of dyed stuff,
there is a volume in the matter;
if her eyelids sink into sleep,
there are new jobs for the author,
and if she plays with me with her shirt off,
we shall construct many iliads.
and whatever she does or says we shall spin long yarns out of nothing
thus much the fates have allotted me,
and if, maecenas,
i were able to lead heroes into armour,
i would not,
neither would i warble of titans,
nor of ossa spiked onto olympus,
nor of causeways over pelion,
nor of thebes in its ancient respectability,
nor of homer’s reputation in pergamus,
nor of xerxes’ two-barreled kingdom,
nor of remus and his royal family,
nor of dignified carthaginian characters,
nor of welsh mines
and the profit marus had out of them.
i should remember caesar’s affairs.
for a background,
although callimachus did without them,
and without theseus, without an inferno,
without achilles attended of gods,
without ixion,
and without the sons of menoetius
and the argo and without jove’s grave
and the titans
and my ventricles do not palpitate to caesarial ore rotundos,
nor to the tune of the phrygian fathers

a plowman, concerning his oxen;
soldier, the enumeration of wounds;
the sheep-feeder, of ewes;

turning aside from battles:
each man where he can,
wearing out the day in his manner
it is noble to die of love,
and honourable to remain uncuckolded for a season.
and she speaks ill of light women,
and will not praise homer because helen’s conduct is “unsuitable.

and whenever death closes our eyelids,
moving naked over acheron upon the one raft,
victor and conquered together,
one tangle of shadows
caesar plots against india,
tigris and euphrates shall, from now on,
flow at his bidding,
tibet shall be full of roman policemen,
the parthians shall get used to our statuary
and acquire a roman religion;
one raft on the veiled flood of acheron,
marius and jugurtha together
nor at my funeral either will there be any long trail,
bearing ancestral lares and images;
no trumpets filled with my emptiness,
nor shall it be on an atalic bed;
the perfumed cloths shall be absent.

small talk comes from small bones
me happy, night, night full of brightness;
oh couch made happy by my long delectations;
how many words talked out with abundant candles;
struggles when the lights were taken away;
now with bared breasts she wrestled against me,
tunic spread in delay;
and she then opening my eyelids fallen in sleep,
her lips upon them;
and it was her mouth saying:
sluggard
in how many varied embraces,
our changing arms, her kisses, how many,
lingering on my lips.
turn not venus into a blinded motion,
eyes are the guides of love,
paris took helen naked coming from the bed of menelaus,
endymion’s naked body,
bright bait for diana,
--such at least is the story
while our fates twine together,
sate we our eyes with love;
for long night comes upon you
and a day when no day returns.
let the gods lay chains upon us so
that no day shall unbind them
fool who would set a term to love’s madness,
for the sun shall drive with black horses,
earth shall bring wheat from barley,
the flood shall move toward the fountain ere love know moderations,
the fish shall swim in dry streams
no, now while it may be,
let not the fruit of life cease
dry wreaths drop their petals,
their stalks are woven in baskets,
to-day we take the great breath of lovers,
to-morrow fate shuts us in
though you give all your kisses you give but a few.

that unfortunate woman or an ornamental death will be held to your debit,
the time is come,
the air heaves in torridity,
the dry earth pants against the canicular heat,
but this heat is not the root of the matter:
she did not respect all the gods;
such derelictions have destroyed other young ladies aforetime,
and what they swore in the cupboard wind
and wave scattered away
was venus exacerbated by the existence of a comparable equal?
is the ornamental goddess full of envy
have you contempted juno’s pelasgian temples,
have you denied pallas good eyes?
or is it my tongue

the ten nights of your company you have promised me
light, light of my eyes,
at an exceeding late hour i was wandering,
and intoxicated,
and no servant was leading me,
and a minute crowd of small boys came from opposite,
i do not know what boys,
and i am afraid of numerical estimate,
and some of them shook little torches,
and others held onto arrows,
and the rest laid their chains upon me,
and they were naked, the lot of them,
and one of the lot was given to lust

and the noose was over my neck.
and another said “get him plumb in the middle!
shove along there, shove along!
and another broke in upon this:
he thinks that we are not gods.
nd she has been waiting for the scoundrel,
and in a new sidonian night cap,
and with more than arabian odours,
god knows where he has been,
she could scarcely keep her eyes open enter

we were coming near to the house,
and they gave another yank to my cloak,
and it was morning,
and i wanted to see if she was alone,
and resting,
and cynthia was alone in her bed.
i was stupefied.
i had never seen her looking so beautiful no,
not when she was tunick’d in purple
such aspect was presented to me,
me recently emerged from my visions,
you will observe
that pure form has its value
you are a very early inspector of mistresses.
do you think i have adopted your habits?
there were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,
no signs of a second incumbent
she continued:
no incubus has crushed his body against me,
though spirits are celebrated for adultery.
and i am going to the temple of vesta.
and so on
since
that day i have had no pleasant nights
the harsh acts of your levity!
many and many.
i am hung here, a scare-crow for lovers
escape!
there is, o idiot, no escape,
flee if you like into ranaus,
desire will follow you thither,
though you heave into the air upon the gilded pegasean back,
though you had the feathery sandals of perseus
to lift you up through split air,
the high tracks of hermes would not afford you shelter
amor stands upon you,
love drives upon lovers,
a heavy mass on free necks
it is our eyes you flee, not the city,
you do nothing,
you plot inane schemes against me,
languidly you stretch out the snare with which i am already familiar
and yet again,
and newly rumour strikes on my ears
rumours of you throughout the city,
and no good rumour among them
you should not believe hostile tongues,
beauty is slander’s cock-shy,
all lovely women have known this,
your glory is not outblotted by venom,
phoebus our witness,
your hands are unspotted,
a foreign lover brought down helen’s kingdom,
and she was led back, living, home;
the cytharean brought low by mars’ lechery reigns in respectable heavens
oh, oh, and enough of this,
by dew-spread caverns,
the muses clinging to the mossy ridges;
to the ledge of the rocks;
zeus’ clever rapes, in the old days,
combusted semele’s, of io strayed.

ida has lain with a shepherd,
she has slept between sheep

not in seeking the shore of eos
all things are forgiven for one night of your games.
though you walk in the via sacra,
with a peacock’s tail for a fan
who,
who will be the next man to entrust his girl to a friend?
love interferes with fidelities;
the gods have brought shame on their relatives;
each man wants the pomegranate for himself;
amiable
and harmonious people are pushed incontinent into duels,
a trojan
and adulterous person came to menelaus under the rites of hospitium,
and there was a case in colchis,
jason and that woman in colchis;
and besides, lynceus, you were drunk
could you endure such promiscuity?
she was not renowned for fidelity;
but to jab a knife in my vitals,
to have passed on a swig of poison,
preferable, my dear boy, my dear lynceus,
comrade, comrade of my life, of my purse,
of my person;
but in one bed, in one bed alone,
my dear lynceus i deprecate your attendance;
i would ask a like boon of jove
and you write of achelöus,
who contended with hercules,
you write of adrastus’ horses
and the funeral rites of achenor,
and you will not leave off imitating aeschylus.
though you make a hash of antimachus,
you think you are going to do homer.
and still a girl scorns the gods,
of all these young women
not one has enquired the cause of the world,
nor the modus of lunar eclipses
nor whether there be any patch left of us
after we cross the infernal ripples,
nor if the thunder fall from predestination;
nor anything else of importance

he shakes the trojan weapons of aeneas,
and casts stores on lavinian beaches

for a much larger iliad is in the course of construction
(and to imperial order)
clear the streets o ye greeks
and you also follow him “neath phrygian pine shade:
thyrsis and daphnis upon whittled reeds,
and how ten sins can corrupt young maidens;
kids for a bribe and pressed udders,
happy selling poor loves for cheap apples
tityrus might have sung the same vixen;
corydon tempted alexis,
head farmers do likewise,
and lying weary amid their oats
they get praise from tolerant hamadryads.
go on, to ascraeus’ prescription,
the ancient, respected, wordsworthian:
a flat field for rushes,
grapes grow on the slope.
and behold me,
small fortune left in my house.
me, who had no general for a grandfather!
i shall triumph among young ladies of indeterminate character,
my talent acclaimed in their banquets,
i shall be honoured with yesterday’s wreaths.
and the god strikes to the marrow
like a trained and performing tortoise,
i would make verse in your fashion,
if she should command it,
with her husband asking a remission of sentence,
and even this infamy would not attract numerous readers
were there an erudite or violent passion,
for the nobleness of the populace brooks nothing below its own altitude.
one must have resonance,
resonance and sonority.

varro sang jason’s expedition, varro,
of his great passion leucadia,

catullus the highly indecorous, of lesbia,

and in the dyed pages of calvus,
calvus mourning quintilia,

and now propertius of cynthia,

when the nightingale to his mate sings day-long
and night late my love
and i keep state in bower,
in flower,
’till the watchman on the tower cry:

and the night flies.

bass voice from within.
wait, my good fellow.
for such joy i take with her venust
and noblest to my make to hold embraced,
and will not her forsake for yammer of the cuckold,
though day break.
when the springtime is sweet
and the birds repeat their new song in the leaves,
’tis meet a man go where he will
but from where my heart is set no message i get;
my heart all wakes and grieves;
defeat or luck, i must have my fill
our love comes out like the branch
that turns about on the top of the hawthorne,
with frost
and hail at night suffers despite ’till the sun come,
and the green leaf on the bough
i remember the young day when we set strife away,
and she gave me such gesning,
her love and her ring:
god grant i die not by any man’s stroke ’till i have my hand ’neath her cloak
i care not for their clamour who have come between me
and my charmer,
for i know how words run loose,
big talk and little use.
spoilers of pleasure,
we take their measure
descant on a theme by cerclamon
when the sweet air goes bitter,
and the cold birds twitter where the leaf falls from the twig,
i sough
and sing
that love goes out leaving me no power to hold him
of love i have naught save troubles
and sad thought,
and nothing is grievous as i desirous,
wanting only what no man can get or has got
with the noblest
that stands in men’s sight,
if all the world be in despite i care not a glove.
where my love is,
there is a glitter of sun;
god give me life,
and let my course run ’till i have her i love to lie with
and prove
i do not live, nor cure me,
nor feel my ache--great as it is,
for love will give me no respite,
nor do i know when i turn left or right nor when i go out.
for in her is all my delight
and all that can save me
i shake and burn and quiver from love,
awake and in swevyn,
such fear i have she deliver me not from pain,
who know not how to ask her;
who can not.
two years,
three years i seek
and though i fear to speak out,
still she must know it
if she won’t have me now,
death is my portion,
would i had died
that day i came into her sway.
god!
how softly this kills!
when her love look steals on me.
killed me she has, i know not how it was,
for i would not look on a woman
joy i have none,
if she make me not mad or set me quiet,
or bid me chatter.
good is it to me if she flout or turn me inside out,
and about.
my ill doth she turn sweet.
how swift it is.
for i am traist and loose, i am true,
or a liar, all vile, or all gentle,
or shaking between, as she desire, i,
cerclamon, sorry and glad,
the man whom love had and has ever;
alas!
who’er it please or pain,
she can me retain
i am gone from one joy,
from one i loved never so much,
she by one touch reft me away;
so doth bewilder me i can not say my say nor my desire,
and when she looks on me it seems to me i lose all wit
and sense
the noblest girls men love ’gainst her i prize not as a glove worn
and old.
though the whole world run rack
and go dark with cloud,
light is where she stands,
and a clamour loud in my ears
in orchard under the hawthorne she has her lover till morn,
till the traist man cry out to warn them.
god how swift the night, and day comes on
o plasmatour,
that thou end not the night,
nor take my belovéd from my sight, nor i,
nor tower-man, look on daylight,
’fore god, how swift the night,
and day comes on
lovely thou art,
to hold me close and kisst,
now cry the birds out, in the meadow mist,
despite the cuckold, do thou as thou list,
so swiftly goes the night
and day comes on
my pretty boy,
make we our play again here in the orchard where the birds complain,
’till the traist watcher his song unrein,
ah god!
how swift the night and day comes on.
out of the wind that blows from her,
that dancing and gentle is
and thereby pleasanter,
have i drunk a draught,
sweeter than scent of myrrh.
ah god!
how swift the night.
and day comes on.
venust the lady, and none lovelier,
for her great beauty,
many men look on her,
out of my love will her heart not stir.
by god, how swift the night.
and day comes on
i only,
and who elrische pain support know out love’s heart o’erborne by overlove,
for my desire that is so firm
and straight
and unchanged since i found her in my sight
and unturned since she came within my glance,
that far from her my speech springs up aflame;
near her comes not.
so press the words to arrest it
i am blind to others,
and their retort i hear not.
in her alone, i see, move, wonder.
and jest not.
and the words dilate not truth;
but mouth speaks not the heart outright:
i could not walk roads, flats, dales,
hills, by chance,
to find charm’s sum within one single frame as god hath set in her t’assay
and test it
and i have passed in many a goodly court
to find in hers more charm than rumour thereof.
in solely hers.
measure and sense to mate,
youth and beauty learned in all delight,
gentrice did nurse her up,
and so advance her fair beyond all reach of evil fame,
to clear her worth,
no shadow hath oppresst it
her contact flats not out,
falls not off short.
let her, i pray,
guess out the sense hereof for never will it stand in open prate
until my inner heart stand in daylight,
so that heart pools him when her eyes entrance,
as never doth the rhone,
fulled and untame, pool,
where the freshest tumult hurl to crest it
flimsy another’s joy, false and distort,
no paregale that she springs not above.
her love-touch by none other mensurate.
to have it not?
alas!
though the pains bite deep,
torture is but galzeardy and dance,
for in my thought my lust hath touched his aim.
god!
shall i get no more!
no fact to best it
no delight i, from now, in dance or sport,
nor will these toys a tinkle of pleasure prove,
compared to her,
whom no loud profligate shall leak abroad how much she makes my right.
is this too much?
if she count not mischance what i have said,
then no.
but if she blame,
then tear ye out the tongue
that hath expresst it
the song begs you:
count not this speech ill chance,
but if you count the song worth your acclaim,
arnaut cares lyt who praise or who contest it
