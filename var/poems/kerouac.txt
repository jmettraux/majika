The taste
of rain
Why kneel?

***

The bottom of my shoes
are clean
from walking in the rain.

***

Snap your finger
stop the world
rain falls harder.

***

After the shower
among the drenched roses
the bird thrashing in the bath.

***

Early morning gentle rain,
two big bumblebees
Humming at their work

***

Birds singing
in the dark
—Rainy dawn.

***

The rain has filled
the birdbath
Again, almost

***

Useless, useless,
the heavy rain
Driving into the sea.

***

The little worm
lowers itself from the roof
By a self shat thread

***

Nightfall,
boy smashing dandelions
with a stick.

***

frozen
in the birdbath
A leaf

***

In my medicine cabinet
the winter fly
has died of old age

***

Missing a kick
at the icebox door
It closed anyway.

Early morning yellow flowers,
thinking about
#the drunkards of Mexico.

No telegram today
only more leaves
fell.

Nightfall,
boy smashing dandelions
with a stick.

Holding up my
purring cat to the moon
I sighed.

Drunk as a hoot owl,
writing letters
by thunderstorm.

#Empty baseball field
a robin
hops along the bench.

All day long
wearing a hat
that wasn't on my head.

Crossing the football field
coming home from work
#the lonely businessman.

After the shower
among the drenched roses
the bird thrashing in the bath.

Snap your finger
stop the world
rain falls harder.

Nightfall,
too dark to read the page
too cold.

Following each other
my cats stop
when it thunders.

Wash hung out
by moonlight
Friday night in May.

The bottoms of my shoes
are clean
from walking in the rain.

Glow worm
sleeping on this flower
your light's on.

***

Close your eyes
Landlord knocking
On the back door.

A quiet Autumn night
and these fools
Are starting to argue

#Lonely brickwalls in Detroit
Sunday afternoon
piss call

#O for Vermont again
The barn on an Autumn night

Fiddlydee!
Another day,
Another something-or-other!

Whatever it is, I quit
now I'll let my
breath out

How many cats they need
around here
For any orgy?

Tonight I'll lower
my tail
I've seen them around town

#In Haikkaido a cat
has no luck

#Every cat in Kyoto
can see through the fog.

The birds start singing
but he is in the cat meadows

I'll climb up a tree
and scratch Katapatafataya

If I go out now,
my paws
will get wet

A car is coming but
the cat knows
It's not a snake

#In London-town cats
can sleep
In the butcher's doorway.

I should have scratched
that spot before
I started to sleep

Haiku my eyes!
my mother is calling!

Arms folded
to the moon,
Among the cows.

Birds singing
in the dark
Rainy dawn.

Elephants munching
on grass - loving
Head side by side.

Missing a kick
at the icebox door
It closed anyway.

This July evening,
a large frog
On my door sill.

Catfish fighting for his life,
and winning,
Splashing us all.

Evening coming
the office girl
Unloosing her scarf.

The low yellow
moon above the
Quiet lamplit house

Shall I say no?
fly rubbing
its back legs

Unencouraging sign
the fish store
Is closed.

Nodding against
the wall, the flowers
Sneeze

Straining at the padlock,
the garage doors
At noon

The taste
of rain
Why kneel?

The moon,
the falling star
Look elsewhere

The rain has filled
the birdbath
Again, almost

And the quiet cat
sitting by the post
Perceives the moon

Useless, useless,
the heavy rain
Driving into the sea.

Juju beads on the
#Zen manual:
My knees are cold.

Those birds sitting
out there on the fence
They're all going to die.

The bottoms of my shoes
are wet
from walking in the rain

In my medicine cabinet,
the winter fly
has died of old age.

November - how nasal
the drunken
Conductor's call

The moon had
a cat's mustache
For a second

A big fat flake
of snow
Falling all alone

The summer chair
rocking by itself
In the blizzard

  # How to meditate

lights out
fall, hands a-clasped, into instantaneous
ecstasy like a shot of heroin or morphine,
the gland inside of my brain discharging
the good glad fluid (Holy Fluid) as
i hap-down and hold all my body parts
down to a deadstop trance-Healing
all my sicknesses-erasing all-not
even the shred of a "I-hope-you" or a
Loony Balloon left in it, but the mind
blank, serene, thoughtless. When a thought
comes a-springing from afar with its held
forth figure of image, you spoof it out,
you spuff it off, you fake it, and
it fades, and thought never comes-and
with joy you realize for the first time
"thinking's just like not thinking
So I don't have to think
any more

  # Daydreams for Ginsberg

I lie on my back at midnight
hearing the marvelous strange chime
of the clocks, and know it's mid
night and in that instant the whole
world swims into sight for me
in the form of beautiful swarm
#ing m u t t a worlds
everything is happening, shining
#Buhudda-lands, bhuti
blazing in faith, I know I'm
forever right & all's I got to
do (as I hear the ordinary
extant voices of ladies talking
in some kitchen at midnight
oilcloth cups of cocoa
cardore to mump the
rinnegain in his
darlin drain, i will write
it, all the talk of the world
everywhere in this morning, leaving
open parentheses sections
for my own accompanying inner
thoughts-with roars of me
all brain-all world
roaring-vibrating-I put
it down, swiftly, 1,000 words
(of pages) compressed into one second
of time-I'll be long
robed & long gold haired in
the famous Greek afternoon
of some Greek City
Fame Immortal & they'll
have to find me where they find
#the t h n u p f t of my
shroud bags flying
flag yagging Lucien
Midnight back in their
#mouths-Gore Vidal'll
be amazed, annoyed—
my words'll be writ in gold
and preserved in libraries like
#Finnegans Wake & Visions of Neal

  # 149th Chorus

I keep falling in love
  with my mother,
I dont want to hurt her
—Of all people to hurt.

Every time I see her
  she's grown older
But her uniform always
  amazes me
For its Dutch simplicity
And the Doll she is,
The doll-like way
  she stands
Bowlegged in my dreams,
Waiting to serve me.

#And I am only an Apache
#Smoking Hashi
#In old Cabashy
By the Lamp.

  # Nebraska

April doesnt hurt here
#Like it does in New England
The ground
Vast and brown
Surrounds dry towns
Located in the dust
Of the coming locust
Live for survival, not for "kicks"
Be a bangtail describer,
like of shrouded traveler
#in Textile tenement & the birds fighting in yr ears-like Burroughs exact to describe & gettin $
The Angry Hunger
(hunger is anger)
  who fears the
  hungry feareth
  the angry)
And so I came home
To Golden far away
Twas on the horizon
Every blessed day
As we rolled And we rolled
From Donner tragic Pass
#Thru April in Nevada And out Salt City Way Into the dry Nebraskas And sad Wyomings Where young girls And pretty lover boys
#With Mickey Mantle eyes
Wander under moons
Sawing in lost cradle
And Judge O Fasterc
Passes whiggling by To ask of young love: ,,Was it the same wind Of April Plains eve that ruffled the dress
Of my lost love
#Louanna
In the Western
Far off night
     Lost as the whistle
     Of the passing Train
     Everywhere West
     Roams moaning
  The deep basso
- Vom! Vom!
- Was it the same love
Notified my bones As mortify yrs now
Children of the soft
#Wyoming April night?
  Couldna been!
  But was! But was!"
And on the prairie
The wildflower blows
In the night For bees & birds And sleeping hidden Animals of life.
#The Chicago
Spitters in the spotty street
#Cheap beans, loop, Girls made eyes at me And I had 35 Cents in my jeans
#Then Toledo
Springtime starry
Lover night Of hot rod boys And cool girls A wandering
A wandering
In search of April pain A plash of rain
Will not dispel This fumigatin hell Of lover lane This park of roses Blue as bees
In former airy poses
In aerial O Way hoses
No tamarand And figancine Can the musterand Be less kind
     Sol
     Sol
Bring forth yr Ah Sunflower
  # - Ah me Montana
Phosphorescent Rose
And bridge in
     fairly land
I'd understand it all

  # 3rd Chorus Mexico City Blues

Describe fires in riverbottom
sand, and the cooking;
the cooking of hot dogs
spitted in whittled sticks
over flames of woodfire
with grease dropping in smoke
to brown and blacken
#the salty hotdogs,
and the wine,
and the work on the railroad.

#$275,000,000,000.00 in debt
says the Government
Two hundred and seventy five billion
#dollars in debt
Like Unending
Heaven
And Unnumbered Sentient Beings
Who will be admitted
Not-Numberable
To the new Pair of Shoes
Of White Guru Fleece
O j o !
The Purple Paradise

  # Tenorman

Sweet sad young tenor
Horn slumped around neck
Bearded full of junk
Slouches waiting
For Apocalypse,
Listens to the new
#Negro raw trumpet kid
Tell him the wooden news;
And the beat of the bass
The bass—drives in
Drummer drops a bomb
Piano tinkle tackles
Sweet tenor lifting
#All American sorrows
Raises mouthpiece to mouth
And blows to finger
The iron sounds
