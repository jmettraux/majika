
    It is the conformity of life
    Of the conditions and fate of the Land

    Gilgamesh arose interpreting dreams,
    addressing his mother.
    "My mother! during my night
    I, having become lusty, wandered about
    in the midst of omens.
    And there came out stars in the heavens,
    Like a ... of heaven he fell upon me.
    I bore him but he was too heavy for me.
    He bore a net but I was not able to bear it.
    I summoned the land to assemble unto him,
    that heroes might kiss his feet.
    He stood up before me
    and they stood over against me.
    I lifted him and carried him away unto thee."
    The mother of Gilgamesh she that knows all things,
    said unto Gilgamesh:--
    "Truly oh Gilgamesh he is
    born in the fields like thee.
    The mountains have reared him.
    Thou beholdest him and art distracted(?)
    Heroes kiss his feet.
    Thou shalt spare him....
    Thou shalt lead him to me."
    Again he dreamed and saw another dream
    and reported it unto his mother.
    "My mother, I have seen another
    [dream. I beheld] my likeness in the street.
    In Erech of the wide spaces
    he hurled the axe,
    and they assembled about him.
    Another axe seemed his visage.
    I saw him and was astounded.
    I loved him as a woman,
    falling upon him in embrace.
    I took him and made him
    my brother."
    The mother of Gilgamesh she that knows all things


    that he may join with thee in endeavor."
    (Thus) Gilgamesh solves (his) dream.
    Enkidu sitting before the hierodule

    forgot where he was born.
    Six days and seven nights
    came forth Enkidu
    and cohabited with the courtesan.
    The hierodule opened her mouth
    speaking unto Enkidu.
    "I behold thee Enkidu; like a god thou art.
    Why with the animals
    wanderest thou on the plain?
    Come! I will lead thee
    into the midst of Erech of the wide places,
    even unto the holy house, dwelling place of Anu.
    Oh Enkidu, arise, I will conduct thee
    unto Eanna dwelling place of Anu,
    where Gilgamesh [oppresses] the souls of men(?)
    And as I
    thou shalt ... thyself.
    Come thou, arise from the ground
    unto the place yonder (?) of the shepherd."
    He heard her speak and accepted her words with favor.
    The advice of the woman
    fell upon his heart.
    She tore off one garment
    and clothed him with it.
    With a second garment
    she clothed herself.
    She clasped his hand,
    guiding him like ...
    unto the mighty presence of the shepherd,
    unto the place of the ... of the sheepfolds.
    In ... to shepherd

    Milk of the cattle
    he drank.
    Food they placed before him.
    He broke bread
    gazing and looking.
    But Enkidu understood not.
    Bread to eat,
    beer to drink,
    he had not been taught.
    The hierodule opened her mouth
    and said unto Enkidu:--
    "Eat bread, oh Enkidu!
    It is the conformity of life,
    of the conditions and the fate of the land."
    Enkidu ate bread,
    until he was satiated.
    Beer he drank
    seven times(?).
    His thoughts became unbounded and he shouted loudly.
    His heart became joyful,
    and his face glowed.
    He stroked...
    the hair of the head.
    His body with oil he anointed.
    He became like a man.
    He attired himself with clothes
    even as does a husband.
    He seized his weapon,
    which the panther and lion
    fells in the night time cruelly.
    He captured the wild mountain goats.
    The panther he conquered.
    Among the great sheep for sacrifice
    Enkidu was their guard.
    A man, a leader,
    A hero.
    Unto ... he elevated

    And he made glad.
    He lifted up his eyes,
    and beheld the man,
    and said unto the hierodule
    "Oh harlot, take away the man.
    Wherefore did he come to me?
    I would forget the memory of him."
    The hierodule called unto the man
    and came unto him beholding him.
    She sorrowed and was astonished
    how his ways were ...
    Behold she opened her mouth
    #saying unto Enkidu:--
    "At home with a family [to dwell??]
    is the fate of mankind.
    Thou shouldest design boundaries(??)
    for a city. The trencher-basket put (upon thy head).
    ... an abode of comfort.
    For the king of Erech of the wide places
    open, addressing thy speech as unto a husband.
    Unto Gilgamesh king of Erech of the wide places
    open, addressing thy speech
    as unto a husband.
    He cohabits with the wife decreed for him,
    even he formerly.
    But henceforth
    in the counsel which god has spoken,
    in the work of his presence
    shall be his fate."
    At the mention of the hero
    his face became pale.


    going ...
    and the harlot ... after him.
    He entered into the midst of Erech of the wide places.
    The artisans gathered about him.
    And as he stood in the street
    of Erech of the wide places,
    the people assembled
    disputing round about him:
    "How is he become like Gilgamesh suddenly?
    In form he is shorter.
    In ... he is made powerful.


    Milk of the cattle
    he drank.
    Continually in the midst of Erech weapons
    the heroes purified.
    A project was instituted.
    Unto the hero whose countenance was turned away,
    unto Gilgamesh like a god
    he became for him a fellow.
    For Ishara a couch was laid.

    Enkidu held fast the door
    with his foot,
    and permitted not Gilgamesh to enter.
    They grappled with each other
    goring like an ox.
    The threshold they destroyed.
    The wall they demolished.
    Gilgamesh and Enkidu
    grappled with each other,
    goring like an ox.
    The threshold they destroyed.
    The wall they demolished.
    Gilgamesh bowed
    to the ground at his feet
    and his javelin reposed.
    He turned back his breast.
    After he had turned back his breast,
    Enkidu unto that one
    spoke, even unto Gilgamesh.
    "Even as one did thy mother
    bear thee,
    she the wild cow of the cattle stalls,
    Ninsunna,
    whose head she exalted more than a husband.
    Royal power over the people
    Enlil has decreed for thee."
