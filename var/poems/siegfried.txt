the first act
a rocky cavern in a wood,
in which stands a naturally formed smith's forge,
with big bellows.
mime sits in front of the anvil,
busily hammering at a sword
mime
who has been hammering with a small hammer,
stops working
slavery!
worry!
labour all lost!
the strongest sword that ever i forged,
that the hands of giants fitly might wield,
this insolent urchin for whom it is fashioned can snap in two at one stroke,
as if the thing were a toy
mime throws the sword on the anvil ill-humouredly,
and with his arms akimbo gazes thoughtfully on the ground
there is one sword
that he could not shatter:
nothung's splinters would baffle his strength,
could i but forge those doughty fragments
that all my skill cannot weld anew.
could i but forge the weapon,
shame and toil would win their reward
he sinks further back his head bowed in thought
fafner, the dragon grim,
dwells in the gloomy wood;
with his gruesome
and grisly bulk the nibelung hoard yonder he guards.
siegfried, lusty and young,
would slay him without ado;
the nibelung's ring would then become mine.
the only sword for the deed were nothung,
if it were swung by siegfried's conquering arm;
and i cannot fashion nothung, the sword
he lays the sword in position again,
and goes on hammering in deep dejection
slavery!
worry!
labour all lost!
the strongest sword
that ever i forged will never serve for
that difficult deed.
i beat
and i hammer only to humour the boy;
he snaps in two what i make,
and scolds if i cease from work
he drops his hammer
siegfried
in rough forester's dress,
with a silver horn hung by a chain,
bursts in boisterously from the wood.
he is leading a big bear by a rope of bast,
and urges him towards mime in wanton fun
hoiho!
hoiho
entering
come on!
come on!
tear him!
tear him!
the silly smith
mime drops the sword in terror,
and takes refuge behind the forge;
while siegfried, shouting with laughter,
keeps driving the bear after him
mime
hence with the beast!
i want not the bear
siegfried
i come thus paired the better to pinch thee;
bruin, ask for the sword
mime
hey!
let him go!
there lies the weapon;
it was finished to-day
siegfried
then thou art safe for to-day
he lets the bear loose
and strikes him on the back with the rope
off, bruin!
i need thee no more
the bear runs back into the wood
comes trembling from behind the forge
slay all the bears thou canst,
and welcome;
but why thus bring the beasts home alive
sits down to recover from his laughter
for better companions seeking than the one who sits at home,
i blew my horn in the wood,
till the forest glades resounded.
what i asked with the note was if some good friend my glad companion would be.
from the covert came a bear who listened to me with growls,
and i liked him better than thee,
though better friends i shall find.
with a trusty rope i bridled the beast,
to ask thee, rogue, for the weapon
he jumps up and goes towards the anvil
mime
takes up the sword to hand it to siegfried
i made the sword keen-edged;
in its sharpness thou wilt rejoice
he holds the sword anxiously in his hand;
siegfried snatches it from him
what matters an edge keen sharpened,
unless hard and true the steel
testing the sword
hei!
what an idle, foolish toy!
wouldst have this pin pass for a sword
he strikes it on the anvil,
so that the splinters fly about.
mime shrinks back in terror
there, take back the pieces,
pitiful bungler!
'tis on thy skull it should have been broken!
shall such a braggart still go on boasting,
telling of giants and prowess in battle,
of deeds of valour,
and dauntless defence?
a sword true
and trusty try to forge me,
praising the skill he does not possess?
when i take hold of what he has hammered,
the rubbish crumbles at a mere touch!
were not the wretch too mean for my wrath,
i would break him in bits as well as his work
the doting fool of a gnome!
and end the annoyance at once
siegfried throws himself on to a stone seat in a rage.
mime all the time has been cautiously keeping out of his way
mime
again thou ravest like mad,
ungrateful and perverse.
if what for him i forge is not perfect on the spot,
too soon the boy forgets the good things i have made!
wilt never learn the lesson of gratitude,
i wonder?
thou shouldst be glad to obey him who always treated thee well
siegfried turns his back on mime in a bad temper,
and sits with his face to the wall
thou dost not like to be told that
he stands perplexed,
then goes to the hearth in the kitchen
but thou wouldst fain be fed.
wilt eat the meat i have roasted,
or wouldst thou prefer the broth?
'twas boiled solely for thee
he brings food to siegfried, who,
without turning round,
knocks both bowl and meat out of his hand
siegfried
meat i roast for myself;
sup thy filthy broth alone
in a wailing voice, as if hurt
this is the reward of all my love!
all my care is paid for with scorn.
when thou wert a babe i was thy nurse,
made the mite clothing to keep him warm,
brought thee thy food, gave thee to drink,
kept thee as safe as i keep my skin;
and when thou wert grown i waited on thee,
and made a bed for thy slumber soft.
i fashioned thee toys
and a sounding horn,
grudging no pains, wert thou but pleased.
with counsel wise i guided thee well,
with mellow wisdom training thy mind.
sitting at home, i toil and moil;
to heart's desire wander thy feet.
through thee alone worried,
and working for thee, i wear myself out,
a poor old dwarf
sobbing
and for my trouble the sole reward is by a hot-tempered boy
sobbing
to be hated and plagued
siegfried
has turned round again
and has quietly watched mime's face,
while the latter, meeting the look,
tries timidly to hide his own
thou hast taught me much, mime,
and many things i have learned;
but what thou most gladly hadst taught me a lesson too hard has proved
how to endure thy sight.
when with my food or drink thou dost come,
i sup off loathing alone;
when thou dost softly make me a bed,
my sleep is broken and bad;
when thou wouldst teach me how to be wise,
fain were i deaf and dumb.
if my eyes happen to fall on thee,
i find all thou doest amiss and ill-done;
when thou dost stand, waddle and walk,
shamble and shuffle,
with thine eyelids blinking,
by the neck i want to take the nodder,
and choke the life from the hateful twitcher.
so much, o mime, i love thee!
hast thou such wisdom, explain,
i pray thee, a thing i have wondered at:
though i go roaming just to avoid thee,
why do i always return?
though i love the beasts all better than thee
tree
and bird and the fish in the brook,
one
and all they are dearer than thou
how is it i always return?
of thy wisdom tell me that
mime
tries to approach him affectionately
my child,
that ought to show thee
that mime is dear to thy heart
siegfried
i said i could not bear thee;
forget not that so soon
mime
recoils, and sits down again apart,
opposite siegfried.
the wildness
that thou shouldst tame is the cause,
bad boy, of that.
young ones are always longing after their parents' nest;
what we love we all long for,
and so thou dost yearn for me;
'tis plain thou lovest thy mime,
and always must love him.
what the old bird is to the young one,
feeding it in its nest ere the fledgling can flutter,
that is what careful,
clever mime to thy young life is,
and always must be
siegfried
well, mime, being so clever,
this one thing more also tell me
simply
the birds sang together so gaily in spring
and there i learned what love was like
tenderly
the one alluring the other;
and thou didst say, when i asked thee why,
that they were wives with their husbands
they chattered so sweetly,
were never apart;
they builded a nest in which they might brood;
the fluttering young ones came flying out,
and both took care of the young.
the roes in the woods, too,
rested in pairs, the wild wolves even,
and foxes.
food was found them
and brought by the father,
the mother suckled the young ones.
and there i learned what love was like;
a whelp from its mother i never took.
but where hast thou, mime,
a wife dear and loving,
that i may call her mother
angrily
what dost thou mean?
fool, thou art mad!
art thou then a bird or a fox
siegfried
when i was a babe thou wert my nurse,
made the mite clothing to keep him warm;
but tell me,
whence did the tiny mite come?
could babe without mother be born to thee
greatly embarrassed
thou must always trust what i tell thee.
i am thy father and mother in one
siegfried
thou liest, filthy old fright!
the resemblance 'twixt child
and parent i often have seen for myself.
i came to the limpid brook,
and the beasts
and the trees i saw reflected;
sun and clouds too, just as they are,
were mirrored quite plain in the stream.
i also could spy this face of mine,
and quite unlike thine seemed it to me;
as little alike as a fish to a toad:
and when had fish toad for its father
very angrily
how canst thou talk such terrible stuff
with increasing animation
listen!
at last i understand what in vain i pondered so long:
why i roam the woods
and run to escape thee,
yet return home in the end
he springs up
i cannot go till thou tell me what father
and mother were mine
mime
what father?
what mother?
meaningless questions
siegfried
springs upon mime,
and seizes him by the throat
to answer a question thou must be caught first;
willingly thou never wilt speak;
thou givest nothing unless forced to.
how to talk i hardly had learned had it not by force been wrung from the wretch.
come, out with it, mangy old scamp!
who are my father and mother
sees himself in the stream
mime
after makings signs with his head
and hands,
is released by siegfried
dost want to kill me outright!
hands off,
and the facts thou shalt hear,
as far as known to myself.
o ungrateful and graceless child,
now learn the cause of thy hatred!
neither thy father nor kinsman i,
and yet thou dost owe me thy life!
to me, thy one friend,
a stranger wert thou;
it was pity alone sheltered thee here;
and this is all my reward.
and i hoped for thanks like a fool
a woman once i found who wept in the forest wild;
i helped her here to the cave,
that by the fire i might warm her.
the woman bore a child here;
sadly she gave it birth.
she writhed about in pain;
i helped her as i could.
bitter her plight;
she died.
but siegfried lived and throve
slowly
my poor mother died, then, through me
mime
to my care she commended thee;
'twas willingly bestowed.
the trouble mime would take!
the worry kind mime endured!
when thou wert a babe i was thy nurse.
siegfried
that story i often have heard.
now say, whence came the name siegfried
mime
'twas thus
that thy mother told me to name thee,
that thou mightst grow to be strong
and fair.
i made the mite clothing to keep it warm.
siegfried
now tell me, what name was my mother's
mime
in truth i hardly know.
brought thee thy food,
gave thee to drink.
siegfried
my mother's name thou must tell me
mime
her name i forget.
yet wait!
sieglinde,
that was the name borne by her who gave thee to me.
i kept thee as safe as i keep my skin.
siegfried
with increasing urgency
next tell me, who was my father
roughly
him i have never seen
mime finds the mother in the forest
siegfried
but my mother told it thee, surely
mime
he fell in combat was all that she said.
she left the fatherless babe to my care.
and when thou wert grown i waited on thee,
and made a bed for thy slumber soft"
siegfried
still, with thy tiresome starling song!
that i may trust thy story,
convinced thou art not lying,
thou must produce some proof
mime
but what proof will convince thee
siegfried
i trust thee not with my ears,
i trust thee but with mine eyes:
what witness speaks for thee
mime
after some thought takes from the place where they are concealed the two pieces of a broken sword
i got this from thy mother:
for trouble, food,
and service this was my sole reward.
behold, 'tis a splintered sword!
she said 'twas borne by thy father in the fatal fight when he fell
enthusiastically
and thou shalt forge these fragments together,
and furnish my rightful sword!
up!
tarry not, mime;
quick to thy task!
if thou hast skill, thy cunning display.
cheat me no more with worthless trash;
these fragments alone henceforth i trust.
lounge o'er thy work, weld it not true,
trickily patching the goodly steel,
and thou shalt learn on thy limbs how metal best should be beat!
i swear
that this day the sword shall be mine;
my weapon to-day i shall win
alarmed
what wouldst thou to-day with the sword
siegfried
leave the forest for the wide world,
never more to return.
ah, how fair a thing is freedom!
nothing holds me or binds!
no father have i here,
and afar shall be my home;
thy hearth is not my house,
nor my covering thy roof.
like the fish glad in the water,
like the finch free in the heavens,
off i will float, forth i will fly,
like the wind o'er the wood wafted away,
thee, mime, beholding no more
he runs into the forest
greatly alarmed
stop, boy!
stop, boy!
whither away?
hey!
siegfried!
siegfried!
hey
he looks after the retreating figure for some time in astonishment;
then he goes back to the smithy
and sits down behind the anvil
he storms away!
and i sit here:
to crown my cares comes still this new one;
my plight is piteous indeed!
how help myself now?
how hold the boy here?
how lead the young madcap to fafner's lair?
and how weld the splinters of obstinate steel?
in no furnace fire can they be melted,
nor can mime's hammer cope with their hardness
shrilly
the nibelung's hate,
need and sweat cannot make nothung whole,
never will weld it anew
sobbing,
he sinks in despair on to a stool behind the anvil
wanderer (wotan)
enters from the wood by the door at the back of the cave.
he wears a long dark blue cloak, and,
for staff, carries a spear.
on his head is a round,
broad-brimmed slouched hat
all hail, cunning smith!
a seat by thy hearth kindly grant the wayworn guest
starting up in alarm
who seeks for me here in desolate woods,
finds my home in the forest wild
approaching very slowly step by step
wanderer names me the world, smith.
from far i have come;
on the earth's back ranging,
much i have roamed
mime
if wanderer named,
pray wander from here without halting for rest
wanderer
good men grudge me not welcome;
many gifts i have received.
by bad hearts only is evil feared
mime
ill fate always dwelt by my side;
thou wouldst not add to it, surely
slowly coming nearer and nearer
always searching, much have i seen;
things of weight have told to many;
oft have rid men of their troubles,
gnawing and carking cares
mime
though thou hast searched,
and though much thou hast found,
i need neither seeker nor finder.
lonely am i, and lone would be;
idlers i harbour not here
again coming a little nearer
there were many thought they were wise,
yet what they needed knew not at all;
useful lore was theirs for the asking,
wisdom was their reward
mime
more
and more anxious as he sees the wanderer approach
idle knowledge some may covet;
i know enough for my needs
the wanderer reaches the hearth
my own wits suffice, i want no more, so,
wise one, keep on thy way
sitting down at the hearth
nay,
here at thy hearth i vow by my head to answer all thou shalt ask.
my head is thine, 'tis forfeit to thee,
unless i can give answers good,
deftly redeeming the pledge
mime
who has been staring at the wanderer open-mouthed,
now shrinks back;
aside, dejectedly
now how to get rid of the spy?
the questions asked must be artful
he summons up courage for an assumption of sternness;
aloud
thy head for thy lodging pays:
'tis pawned;
now seek to redeem it.
three the questions thou shalt be asked
wanderer
thrice then i must answer
pulls himself together and reflects
since,
far on the back of the wide earth roving,
thy feet have ranged o'er the world, come,
answer me this:
tell me what race dwells in the earth's deep gorges
wanderer
in the depths of earth the nibelungs have their home;
nibelheim is their land.
black elves they all are;
black alberich once was their ruler
and lord.
he subdued the busy folk by a ring gifted with magical might;
and they piled up shimmering gold,
precious, fine-wrought,
to win him the world and its glory
proceed with thy questions, dwarf
mime
sinks into deeper and deeper meditation
thou knowest much, wanderer,
of the hidden depths of earth.
now, answer me this:
tell me what race breathes on earth's back
and moves there
wanderer
on the earth's broad back the race of the giants arose;
riesenheim is their land.
fasolt
and fafner, the rude folk's rulers,
envied the nibelung's might.
so his wonderful hoard they won for themselves,
and with it gained the ring too.
the brothers quarrelled about the ring,
and slain was fasolt.
in dragon's form fafner now watches the hoard
one question threatens me still
quite lost in thought
much, wanderer,
thou dost know of the earth's back rude
and rugged.
now answer aright:
tell me what race dwells above in the clouds
wanderer
above in the clouds dwell the immortals;
walhall is their home.
they are light-spirits;
light-alberich, wotan,
rules as their lord.
from the world-ash-tree's holiest bough once wotan made him a shaft.
though the stem rot,
the spear shall endure,
and with
that spear-point wotan rules the world.
trustworthy runes of holy treaties deep in the shaft he cut.
who wields the spear carried by wotan the haft of the world holds in his hand.
before him kneels the nibelung host;
the giants, tamed, bow to his will.
all must obey, and for ever,
the spear's eternal lord
he strikes the ground with the spear as if by accident,
and a low growl of thunder is heard,
by which mime is violently alarmed
confess now, cunning dwarf,
are not my answers right,
and is not my head redeemed
mime
after attentively watching the wanderer with the spear,
becomes very frightened,
seeks in a confused manner for his tools,
and looks timidly aside
both thou hast won, wager and head;
thy way now, wanderer, go
wanderer
knowledge useful to thee thou wert to ask for;
forfeit my head if i failed.
forfeit be thine,
knowest thou not the thing it would serve thee to know.
greeting thou gavest me not;
my head into thy hand i gave
that i might rest by thy hearth.
by wager fair forfeit thy head,
canst thou not answer three things when asked;
so sharpen well, mime, thy wits
in dragon's form fafner now watches the hoard
mime
very much frightened,
and after much hesitation,
at last composes himself with timid submission
long it is since i left my land;
long it seems to me since i was born.
i saw here the eye of wotan shine,
peering into my cave;
his glance dazes my mother-wit.
but well were it now to be wise.
come then, wanderer, ask.
perhaps fortune will favour the dwarf,
and redeem his head
comfortably sitting down again
then first, honest dwarf,
answer this question:
tell the name of the race
that wotan treats most harshly
very softly, but audibly
and yet loves beyond all the rest
with more cheerfulness
though unlearnèd in heroes' kinship,
this question i answer with ease.
the wälsungs are wotan's chosen stock,
by him begotten and loved with passion,
though they are shown no grace.
siegmund
and sieglinde born were to wälse,
a wild and desperate twin-born pair;
siegfried had they as son,
the strongest shoot from the tree.
my head, say, is it still, wanderer, mine
pleasantly
how well thou knowest
and namest the race!
rogue, i see thou art clever.
the foremost question thou hast solved;
the second answer me, dwarf.
a crafty niblung shelters siegfried,
hoping he will slay fafner,
that the dwarf may be lord of the hoard,
the ring being his.
say, what sword, if fafner to fall is,
must be by siegfried swung
mime
forgetting his present situation more
and more,
rubs his hands joyfully
nothung is the name of the sword;
into an ash-tree's stem wotan struck it;
one only might bear it:
he who could draw it forth.
the strongest heroes tried it and failed;
only by siegmund was it done;
well he fought with the sword till on wotan's spear it was split.
by a crafty smith are the fragments kept,
for he knows
that alone with the wotan sword a brave
and foolish boy,
siegfried, can slay the foe
much pleased
a second time my head have i saved
the wanderer
wanderer laughing
the wisest of wise ones thou must be,
surely;
who else could so clever be!
but wouldst thou by craft employ the boy-hero as instrument of thy purpose,
with one question more i threaten thee.
tell me, thou artful armourer,
whose skill from the doughty splinters nothung the sword shall fashion
mime starts up in great terror
the splinters!
the sword!
alas!
my head reels!
what shall i do?
what can i say?
accursèd sword!
i was mad to steal it!
a perilous pass it has brought me to.
always too hard to yield to my hammer!
rivet, solder-- useless are both
he throws his tools about as if he had gone crazy,
and breaks out in utter despair
the cleverest smith living has failed;
and, that being so, who shall succeed?
how rede aright such a riddle
has risen quietly from the hearth
three things thou wert to ask me;
thrice was i to reply.
thy questions were of far-off things,
but what stood here at thy hand
needed much--that was forgot,
now that i guess it, thou goest crazed,
and won by me is the cunning one's head.
now, fafner's dauntless subduer, hear,
thou death-doomed dwarf.
by him who knows not how to fear nothung shall be forged
mime stares at him;
he turns to go
so ward thy head well from to-day.
i leave it forfeit to him who has never learned to fear
he turns away smiling,
and disappears quickly in the wood.
mime has sunk on to the bench overwhelmed
mime
stares before him into the sunlit wood,
and begins to tremble more
and more violently
accursèd light!
the air is on fire!
what flickers and flashes?
what buzzes and whirs?
what sways there and swings
and circles about?
what glitters
and gleams in the sun's hot glow?
what rustles and hums and rings so loud?
with roll and roar it crashes this way!
it bursts through the wood, making for me
he rises up in terror
its jaws are wide open, eager for prey;
the dragon will catch me!
fafner!
fafner
he sinks shrieking behind the anvil
siegfried
behind the scenes,
is heard breaking from the thicket
ho there!
thou idler!
is the work finished
he enters the cave
quick, come show me the sword
he pauses in surprise
where hides the smith?
has he made off?
hey, there!
mime, thou coward!
where art thou?
where hidest thou
mime
in a small voice, from behind the anvil
'tis thou then, child?
art thou alone
laughing
under the anvil?
why, what doest thou there?
wert thou grinding the sword
comes forward, greatly upset and confused
the sword?
the sword?
how could i weld it
half aside
by him who knows not how to fear nothung shall be forged.
too wise am i to attempt such work
violently
wilt thou speak plainly or must i help thee
as before
where shall i turn in my need?
my wily head wagered and lost is
staring before him
and forfeit to him it will fall who has never learned to fear
vehemently
dost thou by shuffling seek to escape
gradually recovering himself
small need to fly him who knows fear!
but
that lesson was one never taught thee.
a fool, i forgot the one great thing;
what thou wert taught was to love me,
and alas!
the task proved hard.
now how shall i teach thee to fear
seizes him
hey!
must i help thee?
what work hast thou done
mime
concerned for thy good,
in thought i was sitting:
something of weight i would teach thee
laughing
'twas under the seat
that thou wert sitting;
what weighty thing foundest thou there
mime
recovering himself more and more
down there i learned how to fear,
that i might teach thee, dullard
with quiet wonder
this fear then, what is it
mime
thou knowest not that,
yet wouldst from the forest forth to the world?
what help in the trustiest sword,
hadst thou not learned to fear
impatiently
what absurd invention is this
mime
approaching siegfried with more
and more confidence
'tis thy mother's wish speaking through me.
i must fulfil the promise i gave her:
that the world
and its wiles thou shouldst not encounter until thou hadst learned how to fear
vehemently
is it an art?
why was i not taught?
explain:
this fearing, what is it
mime
in the dark wood hast thou not felt,
when shades of dusk fall dim and drear,
when mournful whispers sigh afar,
and fierce growling sounds at hand,
when strange flashes dart and flicker,
and the buzzing and clamour grow--
trembling
hast thou not felt grim horror hold every sense in its clutches?
quaking
when the limbs shiver, shaken with terror
with a quivering voice
and the heart, filled with dismay,
hammers,
bursting the breast
hast thou not yet felt that,
a stranger art thou to fear
musing
wonderful truly that must be.
steadfast,
strong beats my heart in my breast.
the shiver and shudder,
the fever and horror,
burning and fainting,
beating and trembling-- ah,
how glad i would feel them
tenderly
could i but learn this delight!
but how, mime, can it be mine?
how, coward, could it be taught me
mime
following me, the way thou shalt find;
i have thought it all out.
i know of a dragon grim that slays
and swallows men:
fear thou wilt learn from fafner,
when i lead to where he lies
siegfried
where has he his lair
mime
neidhöhl' named,
it lies east towards the end of the wood
siegfried
it lies not far from the world
mime
the world is quite close to the cave
siegfried
that i may learn what this fear is,
lead me there straightway;
then forth to the world!
make haste!
forge me the sword.
in the world fain i would swing it
mime
the sword?
woe's me
siegfried
quick to the smithy!
show me thy work
mime
accursèd steel!
unequal my skill to the task;
the potent magic surpasses the poor dwarf's strength.
'twere more easily done by one who never felt fear
siegfried
artful tricks the idler would play me;
he is a bungler;
he should confess,
and not seek to lie his way out.
here with the splinters!
off with the bungler
coming to the hearth
his father's sword siegfried will weld:
by him shall it be forged
flinging mime's tools about,
he sets himself impetuously to work
mime
if thou hadst practised thy craft with care,
thou wouldst have profited now;
but thou wert far too lazy to learn,
and now at need canst do nothing
siegfried
where the master has failed what hope for the scholar,
had he obeyed him in all
he makes a contemptuous grimace at him
be off with thee!
meddle no more,
in case with the steel i melt thee
he has heaped a large quantity of charcoal on the hearth,
and keeps blowing the fire,
while he screws up the pieces of the sword in a vice
and files them to shavings
mime
who has sat down a little way off,
watches siegfried at work
why file it to bits?
there is the solder all fused,
ready to hand
siegfried
off with the pap, i need it not;
with paste i fashion no sword
mime
now the file is ruined,
the rasp is useless;
why grind thus the steel to splinters
siegfried
it must be shivered
and ground into shreds;
only so can splinters be patched
he goes on filing with great energy
aside
i see a craftsman is useless here;
by his own folly the fool is best served.
look how he toils with lusty strokes;
the steel disappears,
and still he keeps cool
siegfried has blown the fire to a bright flame
though i am as old as cave and wood,
the like i never yet saw
while siegfried continues to file the piece of the sword impetuously,
mime seats himself a little further off
he will forge the sword-- i see it plain
boldly weld it anew.
the wanderer was right.
where shall i hide my luckless head?
if nothing teaches him fear,
forfeit it falls to the boy
springing up
and bending down in growing agitation
but woe to mime!
if siegfried learn fear,
the dragon will never be slain;
and, if so, how gain the ring?
accurst dilemma!
would i escape,
i must find out some way of subduing the boy for myself
siegfried
has now filed down the pieces,
and puts the filings in a crucible,
which he places on the fire
hey, mime!
the name!
quick,
name the sword
that i have pounded to pieces
starts and turns towards siegfried
nothung, that is the name of the sword;
'twas mother told me the tale
siegfried
during the following song keeps blowing the fire with the bellows
nothung!
nothung!
conquering sword!
what blow, i wonder, broke thee.
thy keen-edged glory i chopped to chaff;
the splinters now i am melting.
hoho!
hoho!
hohei!
hohei!
hoho!
bellows blow!
brighten the flame!
in the woods a tree grew wild;
it fell, by my hand hewn down.
the brown-stemmed ash to charcoal i burned;
now it lies heaped high on the hearth.
hoho!
hoho!
hohei!
hohei!
hoho!
bellows blow!
brighten the flame!
how bravely, brightly the charcoal burns!
how clear and fair its fire!
with showering sparks it leaps
and glows,
hohei!
hoho!
hohei!
dissolving the splintered steel!
hoho!
hoho!
hohei!
hohei!
hoho!
bellows, blow!
brighten the flame!
hoho!
hoho!
hoho, hohei!
hohei!
nothung!
nothung!
conquering sword!
thy steel chopped to chaff is fused;
in thine own sweat thou swimmest now
the forging of nothung
he pours the glowing contents of the crucible into a mould,
which he holds up
but soon my sword thou shalt be
mime
during the pauses in siegfried's song,
still aside, sitting at a distance
the sword he will forge
and vanquish fafner,
so much i can clearly foresee;
hoard and ring the victor will have;
how to win them both for myself!
by wit and wiles they shall be captured,
and safe shall be my head
in the foreground, still aside
after the fight, when athirst,
for a cooling draught he will crave;
of fragrant juices gathered from herbs the draught i will brew for him.
let him drink but a drop,
and in slumber softly lapped he shall lie:
with the very sword
that he fashioned to serve him he shall be cleared from my way,
and treasure and ring made mine
he rubs his hands with satisfaction
ha!
dull didst hold me, wanderer wise!
does my subtle scheming please thee now?
have i found a path to peace
he springs up joyfully,
fetches several vessels,
shakes spices
and herbs from them into a pot,
and tries to put it on the hearth
siegfried
has plunged the mould into a pail of water.
steam and loud hissing ensue as it cools
in the water flowed a flood of fire;
furious with hate, grimly it hissed;
though scorching it ran,
in the cooling flood no more it flows;
stiff, stark it became,
hard is the stubborn steel;
yet warm blood shall flow thereby!
now sweat once again,
that swift i may weld thee, nothung,
conquering sword
he thrusts the steel into the fire,
and blows the bellows violently.
while doing so he watches mime, who,
from the other side of the hearth,
carefully puts his pot on the fire
what does the booby make in his pot?
while i melt steel, what art thou brewing
mime
a smith is put to shame,
and learns from the lad he taught;
all the master's lore is useless now;
he serves the boy as cook.
steel thou dost brew into broth;
old mime boils thee eggs for thy meal
he goes on with his cooking
siegfried
mime, the craftsman, learns to cook now,
and cares no longer to forge;
i have broken all the swords
that he made me;
what he cooks my lips shall not touch
during the following he takes the mould from the fire,
breaks it,
and lays the glowing steel on the anvil
to find out what fear is forth he will guide me;
a far-off teacher shall teach me;
even what he does best he cannot do well;
in everything mime must bungle
during the forging
hoho!
hoho!
hohei!
forge me, my hammer, a trusty sword.
hoho!
hahei!
hoho!
hahei!
blood-stained was once thy steely blue,
the crimson trickle reddened thy blade.
how cold was thy laugh!
the warm blood cooled at thy touch!
heiaho!
haha!
haheiaha!
now red thou comest from the fire,
and thy softened steel to the hammer yields.
angry sparks thou dost shower on me who humbled thy pride.
heiaho!
heiaho!
heiahohohohoho!
hahei!
hahei!
hahei!
hoho!
hoho!
hohei!
forge me, my hammer, a trusty sword!
hoho!
hahei!
hoho!
hahei!
how i rejoice in the merry sparks!
the bold look best when by anger stirred!
gay thou laughest to me,
grimly though thou dost pretend!
heiaho, haha, haheiaha!
both heat and hammer served me well;
with sturdy strokes i stretched thee straight;
now banish thy modest blush,
be as cold and hard as thou canst.
heiho!
heiaho!
heiahohohohoho!
heiah
he swings the blade,
plunges it into the pail of water,
and laughs aloud at the hissing
mime
while siegfried is fixing the blade in the hilt,
moves about in the foreground with the bottle into which he has poured the contents of the pot.
aside
he forges a sharp-edged sword:
fafner, the foe of the dwarf, is doomed;
i brewed a deadly draught:
siegfried must perish when fafner falls.
by guile the goal must be reached;
soon shall smile my reward!
for the shining ring my brother once made,
and which with a potent spell he endowed,
the gleaming gold
that gives boundless might
that ring i have won now,
i am its lord
he trots briskly about with increasing satisfaction
alberich even, whom i served,
shall be the slave of mime the dwarf.
as nibelheim's prince i shall descend there,
and all the host shall do my will;
none so honoured as he,
the dwarf once despised!
to the hoard will come thronging gods
and men
with increasing liveliness
the world shall cower, cowed by my nod,
and at my frown shall tremble and fall!
no more shall mime labour and toil,
when others win him unending wealth.
mime, the valiant, mime is monarch,
prince and ruler, lord of the world!
hei, mime!
great luck has been thine!
had any one dreamed of this
siegfried
during the pauses in mime's song has been filing
and sharpening the sword
and hammering it with the small hammer.
he flattens the rivets of the hilt with the last strokes,
and now grasps the sword
nothung!
nothung!
conquering sword!
once more art thou firm in thy hilt.
severed wert thou;
i shaped thee anew,
no second blow thy blade shall shatter.
the strong steel was splintered,
my father fell;
the son who now lives shaped it anew.
bright-gleaming to him it laughs,
and for him its edge shall be keen
swinging the sword before him
nothung!
nothung!
conquering sword!
once more to life i have waked thee.
dead wert thou, in fragments hewn,
now shining defiant and fair.
woe to all robbers!
show them thy sheen!
strike at the traitor,
cut down the rogue!
see, mime, thou smith;
thus sunders siegfried's sword
he strikes the anvil
and splits it in two from top to bottom,
so
that it falls asunder with a great noise.
mime,
who has mounted a stool in great delight,
falls in terror to a fitting position on the ground.
siegfried holds the sword exultantly on high.
the curtain falls
the second act
a deep forest
quite in the background the entrance to a cave.
the ground rises towards a flat knoll in the middle of the stage,
and slopes down again towards the back,
so
that only the upper part of the entrance to the cave is visible to the audience.
to the left a fissured cliff is seen through the trees.
it is night,
the darkness being deepest at the back,
where at first the eye can distinguish nothing at all
alberich
lying by the cliff, gloomily brooding
in night-drear woods by neidhöhl' i keep watch,
with ear alert, keen and anxious eye.
timid day, tremblest thou forth?
pale art thou dawning athwart the dark
a storm arises in the wood on the right,
and from the same quarter there shines down a bluish light
what comes yonder, gleaming bright?
nearer shimmers a radiant form;
it runs like a horse and it shines;
breaks through the wood, rushing this way.
is it the dragon's slayer?
can it mean fafner's death
the wind subsides;
the light vanishes
the glow has gone, it has faded and died;
all is darkness.
who comes there, shining in shadow
wanderer
enters from the wood,
and stops opposite alberich
to neidhöhl' by night i have come;
in the dark who is hiding there
as from a sudden rent in the clouds moonlight streams forth
and lights up the wanderer's figure
alberich
recognises the wanderer
and shrinks back at first in alarm,
but immediately after breaks out in violent fury
'tis thou who comest thus?
what wilt thou here?
go, get thee hence!
begone, thou insolent thief
quietly
schwarz-alberich wanders here?
guardest thou fafner's house
alberich
art thou intent on mischief again?
linger not here!
off with thee straightway!
has grief enough not deluged the earth through thy guile?
spare it further sorrow, thou wretch
wanderer
i come as watcher, not as worker.
the wanderer's way who bars
alberich
thou arch, pestilent plotter!
were i still the blind,
silly fool that i was,
when i was bound thy captive,
how easy were it to steal the ring again from me!
beware!
for thy cunning i know well
mockingly
and of thy weakness i am fully aware too.
thy debts were cancelled,
paid with my treasure;
my ring guerdoned the giants' toil,
who raised thy citadel high.
still on the mighty haft of thy spear there the runes are written plain of the compact made with the churls;
and of
that which by labour they won thou dost not dare to despoil them:
thy spear's strong shaft thou thyself wouldst split;
the staff
that makes thee master of all would crumble to dust in thy hand
wanderer
by the steadfast runes of treaties thou hast not,
base one, been bound;
on thee my spear may spend its strength,
so keen i keep it for war
alberich
how dire thy threats!
how bold thy defiance!
and yet full of fear is thy heart!
foredoomed to death through my curse is he who now guards the treasure.
what heir will succeed him?
will the hoard all desire belong as before to the niblung?
that gnaws thee with ceaseless torment.
for once i have got it safe in my grasp,
better than foolish giants will i employ its spell.
the god who guards heroes truly may tremble!
i will storm proud walhall with hella's hosts,
and rule, lord of the world
quietly
thy design i know well, but little i care:
who wins the ring will rule by its might
alberich
thou speakest darkly,
but to me all is plain.
thy heart is bold because of a boy
mockingly
a hero begot of thy blood.
hast thou not fostered a stripling to pluck the fruit thou durst not
with growing violence
pluck frankly for thyself
lightly
with me 'tis useless to wrangle;
but mime thou shouldst beware;
for thy brother brings here a boy to compass the giant's doom.
he knows not of me;
he works for mime alone.
and so i say to thee,
do as seems to thee best
alberich makes a movement expressive of violent curiosity
take my advice, be on thy guard:
the boy will hear of the ring when mime tells him the tale
violently
wilt thou hold thy hand from the hoard
wanderer
whom i love must fight for himself unaided;
the lord of his fate, he stands or falls:
all my hope hangs upon heroes
alderich
does none but mime dispute me the ring
wanderer
only thou and mime covet the gold
alderich
and yet it is not to be mine
quietly coming nearer
a hero comes to set the hoard free;
two nibelungs yearn for the gold.
fafner falls, he who guards the ring;
then a hand, seizing, shall hold it.
more wouldst thou learn,
there fafner lies, who,
if warned of his death,
gladly would give up the toy.
come, i will wake him for thee
he goes towards the cave, and,
standing on the rising ground in front of it,
calls towards it
fafner!
fafner!
wake, dragon!
wake
with anxious amazement, aside
does the madman mean it?
am i to have it
fafner's voice
who troubles my sleep
facing the cave
a well-wisher comes to warn thee of danger;
thy doom can be averted,
if thou wilt pay the price with the treasure
that thou guardest
he leans his ear towards the cave,
listening
fafner's voice
what would he
alberich
has come to the wanderer
and calls into the cave
waken, fafner!
dragon, awake!
a doughty hero comes to try his strength against thine
fafner's voice
i want a meal
wanderer
bold is the boy and strong;
sharp-edged is his sword
alberich
the ring he seeks, nothing besides.
give me the ring,
and so the strife shall be stayed.
still guarding the hoard,
in peace shalt thou live long
yawning
i have and i hold:
let me slumber
wanderer
laughs aloud
and then turns again to alberich
well, alberich!
that ruse failed,
but call me rogue no more.
this one thing thou shouldst never forget:
each according to his kind must act;
nothing can change him.
i leave thee the field now;
show a bold front,
and try thy luck with thy brother;
thou knowest his kind perhaps better.
and things unknown thou also shalt learn
he turns away,
and disappears quickly in the wood.
a storm arises
and a bright light breaks forth;
then both quickly cease
alberich
looks after the wanderer as he gallops off
away on his shining horse he rides,
and leaves me to care and scorn!
laugh on!
laugh on,
ye light-minded
and high-spirited race of immortals!
one day ye shall perish and pass!
until the gold has ceased to gleam,
will wise alberich watch,
and his hate shall prevail
he slips into the chasm at the side.
the stage remains empty.
dawn
as the day dawns siegfried
and mime enter.
siegfried carries his sword in a sword-belt of rope.
mime examines the place carefully.
at last he looks towards the background,
which remains in deep shadow,
whilst the rising ground in the middle becomes,
after a time,
more
and more brightly illuminated by the sun
mime
our journey ends here;
here we halt
siegfried
sits down under the lime-tree
and looks about him
so here i shall learn what fear is?
a far way thou hast led me;
we have wandered lone together a whole night long in the woods.
this is the last of thee, mime!
can i not master my lesson here,
alone i will push forward
and never see thee again
mime
lad, believe me,
if thou canst not learn it here and now,
no other place,
no other time ever will teach thee fear.
dost thou see that cavern yawning dark?
yonder dwells a dragon dread and grim,
horribly fierce, enormous in size,
with terrible jaws that threaten
and gape;
with skin and hair, all at a gulp,
the brute could swallow thee whole
siegfried
still sitting under the lime-tree
'twere well to close up his gullet;
his fangs i will therefore avoid
mime
poison pours from his venomous mouth;
were he to spue out spittle on thee,
thy body and bones would decay
siegfried
that the poison may not consume me,
i will keep out of its reach
mime
a serpent's tail sweeping he swings;
were that about thee wound
and folded close,
thy limbs would be broken like glass
siegfried
that his swinging tail may not touch me,
warily then i must watch.
but answer me this:
has the brute a heart
mime
a pitiless, cruel heart
siegfried
it lies, however, where all hearts lie,
brute and human alike
mime
of course!
there, boy, the dragon's lies too.
at last thou beginnest to fear
siegfried
who till now has been lying indolently stretched out,
sits up suddenly
nothung into his heart i will thrust!
is that what is meant by fearing?
hey, old dotard!
canst thou teach me nothing but this with all thy craft,
linger no longer by me:
no fear is here to be learnt
mime
wait awhile yet!
what i have told thee seems to thee empty sound;
when thou hast heard
and seen him thyself,
thy senses will swoon, overwhelmed!
when thine eyes grow dim,
and when the ground rocks,
when in thy breast thy heart beats loud
very friendly
thou wilt remember who brought thee,
and think of me and my love
siegfried
thy love is not wanted!
hast thou not heard?
out of my sight with thee;
let me alone!
begin again talking of love,
and on the instant i go!
the horrible winking,
the nods
and blinking
when shall i see the last of them,
and rid be at length of the fool
mime
well, i will off,
and rest there by the spring.
thou must stay here,
and as the sun scales the sky watch for the foe:
from his cave he lumbers this way,
winds and twists past this spot,
to water at the fountain
laughs
liest thou by the spring,
unchecked thither the brute shall go;
he shall swallow thee down with the water,
ere with my sword to the heart i stab him!
so heed well what i say:
rest not beside the spring.
seek somewhere else a far-off spot,
and nevermore return
mime
thou wilt not refuse cooling refreshment when the fierce fight is over
siegfried motions him angrily away
call on me too shouldst thou need counsel
siegfried repeats the gesture with more violence
or if felled on a sudden by fear
siegfried rises
and drives him away with furious gestures
aside, as he goes away
fafner and siegfried-- siegfried
and fafner
might each the other but slay
he disappears in the wood on the right
siegfried
stretches himself at his ease under the lime-tree,
and looks after mime as he departs
he is no father of mine!
how merry of heart i feel!
never before seemed the forest fair;
never day wore as lovely a smile,
for the loathed one has gone at last,
to be looked on by me no more
he meditates in silence
my father--what was he like?
ha!
like me, without doubt.
had mime by chance had a son,
he would have been mime's image:
quite as disgusting, filthy and grey,
small and bent, hunchbacked and halting,
with ears long and hanging,
rheumy eyes running
off with the fright!
to see him makes me sick
he leans further back
and looks up through the branches of the tree.
deep silence.
woodland murmurs
what could my mother, i wonder, be like;
that is not so easy to picture
very tenderly
her clear shining eyes must have been soft,
and gentle like the roe-deer's,
only far fairer
very softly
in fear and woe she bore me,
but why did she die through me?
must then all human mothers thus die on giving birth to a son?
that would truly be sad!
ah, if i only could see my mother!
see my mother, a woman once
he sighs softly,
and leans still further back.
deep silence.
louder murmuring of the wood.
his attention is at last caught by the song of the birds.
he listens with growing interest to one singing in the branches above him
o lovely warbler, i know not thy note;
hast thou thy home in this wood?
if i could but understand him,
his sweet song might say much
perhaps of my mother tell me.
a surly old dwarf said to me once
that men might learn to follow the sense of birds when they were singing;
could it indeed be done?
ha!
i will sing after him,
on the reed follow him sweetly.
though wanting the words,
repeating his measure
singing what is his language
perhaps i shall know what he says
he runs to the neighbouring spring,
cuts a reed off with his sword,
and quickly makes himself a pipe out of it.
he listens again
he stops to hear, so now for my song
he blows into the pipe, breaks off,
and cuts it again to improve it.
he resumes his blowing, shakes his head,
and cuts the pipe once more.
after another attempt he gets angry,
presses the pipe with his hand,
and tries again.
he ceases playing and smiles
that rings not right;
for the lovely tune the reed is not suited at all.
i fear, sweet bird, i am too dull;
thy song cannot i learn
he hears the bird again
and looks up to him
he listens so roguishly there
that he shames me
very tenderly
he waits, and nothing rewards him.
heida!
come hearken now to my horn
he flings the pipe away
all i do sounds wrong on the stupid reed;
to a song of the woods that i know,
a merry song, listen now rather.
i hoped it would bring some comrade to me,
but wolves
and bears were the best that came.
now i will see who answers its note:
what comrade will come to its call
he takes the silver hunting-horn
and blows on it.
during the long-sustained notes he keeps his eyes expectantly on the bird.
a movement in the background.
fafner,
in the form of a monstrous lizard-like dragon,
has risen from his lair in the cave.
he breaks through the underwood
and drags himself up to the higher ground,
so
that the front part of his body rests on it,
while he utters a loud sound,
as if yawning
siegfried
looks round
and gazes at fafner in astonishment.
he laughs
my horn with its note has allured something lovely;
a jolly companion wert thou
fafner
at the sight of siegfried has paused on the high ground,
and remains there
what is that
siegfried
if thou art a beast who can use its tongue,
perchance thou couldst teach me something.
here stands one who would learn to fear;
say, wilt thou be his teacher
fafner
is this insolence
siegfried
courage or insolence, what matter?
with my sword i will slay thee,
wilt thou not teach me to fear
makes a laughing sound
drink i came for;
now food i find too
he opens his jaws and shows his teeth
siegfried
what a fine set of teeth thou showest me there!
sweetly they smile in thy dainty mouth!
'twere well if i closed up thy gullet;
thy jaws are gaping too wide
fafner
they were not made for idle talk,
but they will serve to swallow thee
siegfried
hoho!
ferocious, merciless churl!
i have no fancy to be eaten.
better it seems to me
that without delay thou shouldst die
roaring
pruh!
come, boy, with thy boasts
draws his sword
beware, growler!
the boaster comes
he springs towards fafner
and remains defiantly confronting him.
fafner drags himself further up the knoll
and spits at siegfried from his nostrils.
siegfried avoids the poison,
springs nearer, and stands on one side.
fafner tries to reach him with his tail.
siegfried, who is nearly caught,
springs over fafner with one bound,
and wounds him in the tail.
fafner roars, pulls his tail angrily away,
and raises the front part of his body so
that he may throw its full weight on siegfried,
thus offering his breast to the stroke.
siegfried quickly looks to see where his heart is,
and thrusts his sword into it up to the hilt.
fafner raises himself still higher in his pain,
and,
when siegfried has let go his sword
and sprung aside,
he sinks on the wound
siegfried kills fafner
siegfried
lie there, envious brute!
nothung's point home has speeded
in a weaker voice
who art thou, boy bold-hearted,
that hast pierced my breast?
who stirred up thy childish soul to the murderous deed?
thy brain schemed not the harm wrought by thy hand
siegfried
not much have i learned,
not even who i am;
thou thyself with thy taunting stirred me to fight
and to slay
fafner
o boy bright-eyed,
who knowest not yet who thou art,
whom thou hast murdered hear from me.
two mighty giants there were,
fasolt and fafner;
the brothers now are both fallen.
for the cursèd gold we got from the gods i did fasolt to death.
he who now guards the hoard as dragon,
fafner, the last remaining, falls,
by a rosy boy slain.
boy in thy bloom, watch and be wary:
he who stirred thee blind to this deed takes thought how to compass thy death
dying
mark the ending!
think on me
siegfried
who was my father?
tell, if thou canst.
dying, thou showest, wild one,
much wisdom.
siegfried my name is;
haply that may help thee to guess
fafner
siegfried
he raises himself and dies
siegfried
the dead can tell no tidings.
my living sword, lead!
lead onward, my sword
fafner has rolled to the side in dying.
siegfried now draws the sword from his breast.
in doing so his hand gets sprinkled with the blood;
he draws it back quickly
the hot blood burns like fire
involuntarily he raises his fingers to his mouth to suck the blood from them.
as he looks musingly before him his attention becomes more
and more attracted by the singing of the birds
i almost seem to hear the birds speaking to me.
is there a spell, perhaps, in the blood?
the curious bird up there-- hark!
he sings to me
voice of the wood-bird
from the branches of the lime-tree above siegfried
hei!
siegfried now owns all the nibelung hoard!
oh!
could he the hoard in the cave but find!
tarnhelm, if he could but win it,
would help him to deeds of renown;
and could he discover the ring,
it would make him the lord of the world
the hot blood burns like fire
siegfried
has listened holding his breath
and beaming with delight
thanks, bonnie bird, for the counsel good:
i follow the call
he turns towards the back
and descends to the cave,
where he at once disappears
mime steals up,
looking about him timidly to assure himself of fafner's death.
at the same time alberich comes out of the cleft on the opposite side.
he observes mime,
rushes on him and bars his way,
as the latter turns towards the cave
alberich
on what errand furtive and sly, knave,
dost thou slink
mime
accursèd brother,
that thou shouldst come!
what brings thee here
alberich
rogue, has my gold provoked thy greed?
dost covet my goods
mime
get thee gone quickly!
this corner is mine;
what huntest thou here
alberich
have i disturbed thee, thief, at thy work,
secret and sly
mime
what i have slaved
and toiled to win shall not escape me
alberich
who was it robbed the rhine of gold for the ring?
and whose cunning wrought the spell of magical might
mime
who made the tarnhelm,
changing its wearer's form?
though thou didst want it,
was it designed by thee
alberich
and what of thyself couldst aright have fashioned,
thou bungler?
the magic ring forced thee to master thy craft
mime
and where is the ring?
'twas reft from thy clutch by the giants.
what thou hast lost i will gain
and keep by my guile
alberich
what the boy has won would the niggard deny him?
'tis not thine;
the hero who won it is now its lord
mime
i brought him up;
for my pains now he shall pay;
for its reward my trouble has waited too long
alberich
just for rearing him, the old niggardly,
beggarly knave, bold as brass,
a king now would become?
the ring would befit better a dog than bumpkin like thee.
never to thee the magical ring shall fall
scratches his head
well, keep it, then,
and guard with care the gleaming gold;
be thou lord, but treat me as a brother;
give me against it tarnhelm for toy,
fairly exchanged;
divided thus, there will be booty for both
he rubs his hands confidingly
with a mocking laugh
share it with thee?
and the tarnhelm too!
how sly thou art!
i could never sleep for a moment safely
beside himself
what!
not even strike a bargain!
i must go bare, beggared of gain!
thou wouldst leave me with nothing
shrieking
alberich
nothing, not so much as a nail,
shall fall to thy portion
in a fury
neither ring nor tarnhelm shall thy hand touch,
then;
'tis i will not share!
i will call on siegfried,
summon the aid of his keen-edged sword;
the lad will make short work,
dear brother, of thee
alberich
siegfried having appeared in the background
turn and look there!
from the cavern hither he comes
mime
he will have chosen trivial toys
alberich
he bears the tarnhelm
mime
also the ring
alberich
curst luck!
the ring
laughing maliciously
get him to give thee the ring now!
'tis i, not thou, who shall win it
alberich
and yet to its lord must it at last be surrendered
he disappears in the cleft
during the foregoing siegfried,
with tarnhelm and ring,
has come slowly
and meditatively from the cave;
he regards his booty thoughtfully,
and stops on the knoll in the middle of the stage
siegfried
i do not know of what use ye are;
i chose you from out the heaped-up hoard because of friendly advice.
meanwhile,
of this day be ye worn as witness,
recalling to mind how with fallen fafner i fought,
and yet could not learn how to fear
he hangs the tarnhelm on his girdle
and puts the ring on his finger.
silence.
his notice is involuntarily drawn to the bird again,
and he listens to him with breathless attention
the dwarfs quarrelling over the body of fafner
the wood-bird's voice
hei!
siegfried now owns both the helm
and the ring!
oh!
let him not listen to mime, the false!
he were wise to be wary of mime's treacherous tongue.
he will understand mime's secret intent,
because he has tasted the blood
siegfried's mien
and gestures show
that he has understood the bird's song.
he sees mime approaching,
and remains without moving,
leaning on his sword,
observant and self-contained,
in his place on the knoll till the close of the following scene
mime
steals forward,
and observes siegfried from the foreground
he weighs in his mind the booty's worth;
can there by chance have come this way a wanderer wise who talked to the child,
and taught him crafty runes?
doubly sly be then the dwarf;
my snares must be cunning, cleverly set,
that with cajoling
and wily falsehoods the insolent boy i may fool
he goes nearer to siegfried
and welcomes him with flattering gestures
ha!
welcome, siegfried!
say, bold fighter,
hast thou been taught how to fear
siegfried
a teacher still is to find
mime
but the dragon grim has fallen before thee?
a fell and fierce monster was he
siegfried
though grim and spiteful the brute,
i grieve over his death,
while there live still, unpunished,
blacker scoundrels than he was!
the one who bade me slay i hate far more than the slain
very friendly
have patience!
thou wilt not look on me long
[sweetly
in endless sleep soon thine eyelids will be sealed.
thy uses are over
as if praising him
done is the deed;
the only task left for me is to win the booty.
methinks that task will not tax me;
thou wert always easy to fool
siegfried
to me thou art plotting harm, then
astonished
what makes thee think that
continuing tenderly
siegfried, listen, my own one!
i have always loathed thee
and all that are like thee.
it was not from love
that i reared thee with care:
the gold hid in fafner's cave i worked for as my reward
as if he were promising him something nice
if thou wilt not yield it up to me
as if he were ready to lay down his life for him
siegfried, my son, thou plainly must see
as if in friendly jest
i have no choice but to slay thee
siegfried
that i am hated pleases me;
but must i lose my life for thy pleasure
angrily
i never said that;
thou hast made a mistake.
see, thou art weary from stress of strife,
burning with fever and thirst;
mime, the kind one,
to cool thy thirst brought a quickening draught.
while thy blade thou didst melt i brewed thee the drink;
touch it,
and straight thy sword shall be mine,
and mine the hoard and tarnhelm too
tittering
siegfried
so thou of my sword
and all it has won me-- ring
and booty--wouldst rob me
violently
why wilt mistake so my words!
do i drivel or dote?
i use the utmost pains with my speech,
that what in my heart i mean may be hidden;
and the stupid boy misunderstands what i say!
open thy ears, boy, and attend to me!
hear, now, what mime means.
take this:
the drink will refresh thee as my drinks oft have done.
many a time when fretful and bad,
though loth enough,
the draughts i brought thou hast swallowed
siegfried
of a cooling drink i were glad;
say, how has this one been brewed
mime
jesting merrily,
as if describing to him a pleasant state of intoxication which the liquor is to bring about
hei!
just drink it!
trust to my skill.
in mist
and darkness soon shall thy senses be sunk;
none to watch or ward them,
stark-stretched shall thy limbs be.
thou lying thus,
'twere not hard to take the booty
and hide it;
but wert thou to awake,
nevermore would mime be safe,
even owning the ring.
so with the sword he has made so sharp
with a gesture of extravagant joy
first i will hack the child's head off!
then i shall have both rest and the ring
tittering
siegfried
thou wouldst, then, slay me when sleeping
furiously
do what, child?
did i say that
he takes pains to assume the utmost tenderness.
carefully and distinctly
i only mean to chop off thy head
with the appearance of heartfelt solicitude for siegfried's health
for even if i had loathed thee less,
and had not thy scoffs
and my drudgery shameful so loudly urged to vengeance
gently
i should never dare to pause till from my path i thrust thee
jestingly again
how else could i come by the booty,
which alberich covets as well
he pours the liquid into the drinking-horn,
and offers it to siegfried with pressing gestures
now, my wälsung, wolf-begot,
drink the draught and be choked,
and never drink again
tittering
threatens him with his sword
taste thou my sword, loathsome babbler
as if seized by violent loathing,
he gives mime a sharp stroke with his sword.
instantly mime falls dead to the ground.
alberich's voice in mocking laughter from the cleft
siegfried
looking at mime on the ground,
quietly hangs his sword again on his belt
envy's wage pays nothung;
'twas for this that i forged him
he picks up mime's body,
carries it to the knoll,
and throws it into the cave
in the cavern, there, lie on the hoard;
with steadfast guile the gold thou hast gained:
now let it belong to its master!
and a watchman good i give thee,
that thieves never may enter and steal
with a great effort he pushes the body of the dragon in front of the entrance to the cave,
which it completely stops up
there lie thou too, dragon grim;
along with thy foe greedy of gain thou shalt guard the glittering gold:
so both at last shall rest in peace
he looks down thoughtfully into the cave for a time,
and then turns slowly to the front of the stage as if tired.
he passes his hand over his brow
hot i feel from the heavy toil;
fast and furious flows my blood,
my hand burns on my head.
high stands the sun in heaven;
from azure heights falls his gaze through a cloudless sky on my crown.
pleasant shadows will cool me under the linden
he stretches himself out under the lime-tree,
and again looks up through the boughs
if only, pretty warbler,
so long and so rudely disturbed,
i could once more hear thee singing!
on a branch i see thee merrily swaying;
chirping and chattering,
brothers
and sisters are happily hovering round
but i--i am alone,
without brother or sister;
my mother died, my father fell,
unseen by their son!
the one soul i knew was a loathsome old dwarf
warmly
love he festered not by kindness;
many a cunning snare did he set me;
at last i was forced to slay him
he looks sorrowfully up at the branches
bird sweet and friendly,
i ask thee a boon:
wilt thou find for me a comrade true?
wilt thou choose for me the right one?
so oft i have called,
and yet no one has come!
thou, my friend, wilt manage it better,
so wise thy counsel has been
softly
now sing!
i hearken to thy song
the wood-bird's voice
hei!
siegfried has slain the deceitful dwarf!
i know for him now a glorious bride.
she sleeps where rugged rocks soar;
ringed is her chamber by fire.
who battles the flames, wakens the bride,
brünnhilde wins as reward
siegfried
starts up impetuously from his seat
o lovely song, flower-sweet breath!
thy yearning music burns in my breast!
like leaping flame it kindles my heart.
what races so swift through soul
and senses?
sweetest of friends, o say
he listens
the wood-bird's voice
grieving yet glad, love i am singing;
blissful, from woe weaving my song:
they only who yearn understand
siegfried
forth, forth then, swift and rejoicing!
forth from the wood to the fell!
just one thing more i would learn,
sweet singer:
say, shall i break through the fire?
can i awaken the bride
he listens again
the wood-bird's voice
no coward wins brünnhild' for bride,
or wakes the maid:
only a heart without fear
shouting with joy
the foolish boy who has never learned fear,
dear bird, that dullard am i!
to-day i took endless trouble in vain,
to find out what fear was from fafner.
with longing i burn now from brünnhild' to learn it.
what path soonest leads to the fell
the bird flutters up,
circles over siegfried,
and flies hesitatingly before him
siegfried
the bird to my goal will guide me.
fly where thou wilt, i follow thy flight
he runs after the bird,
who for a time flies uncertainly hither
and thither to tease him;
at last he follows him, when,
taking a definite direction towards the back,
the bird flies away
the third act
a wild spot at the foot of a rocky mountain which rises precipitously at the back on the left.
night, storm,
lightning and violent thunder.
the latter ceases shortly,
but the lightning continues to flash from the clouds for some time.
the wanderer enters
and walks resolutely towards a cavernous opening in a rock in the foreground,
and takes up his position there,
leaning on his spear,
while he calls the following towards the entrance to the cave
wanderer
waken, wala!
wala!
awake!
from thy long sleep, slumberer,
wake at my call!
i summon thee forth:
arise!
arise!
from cloud-covered caves in earth's dim abysses,
arise!
erda!
erda, old as the world!
from depths dark
and hidden rise to the day!
with song i call thee,
i sing to wake thee,
from deep dreams of wisdom bid thee arise.
all-knowing one!
fount of knowledge!
erda!
erda, old as the world!
waken!
awaken, thou vala!
awaken
a dim bluish light begins to dawn in the cavern.
in this light erda, during the following,
rises very gradually from below.
she appears to be covered with hoar-frost,
which glitters on her hair and garments
erba
loud is the call;
strong the spell that summons;
i have been roused from dark
and wise dreams:
who wakes me from my sleep
wanderer
'tis i who awake thee with song of magic,
that what in slumber was folded fast may rise.
the wide earth ranging, far i have roamed,
seeking for knowledge,
wisdom at fountains primeval.
no one that lives is wiser than thou;
thou knowest all in the hidden depths,
what moves on hill, dale,
in water and air.
where life is found,
there thou art breathing;
and where brains ponder,
there is thy thought.
men say that all knowledge is thine.
that i might ask of thee counsel,
i have called thee from sleep
erba
my sleep is dreaming,
my dreaming brooding,
my brooding wisdom's calm working.
but while i sleep the norns are wakeful:
they twine the rope,
and deftly weave what i know.
the norns thou shouldst have questioned
wanderer
in thrall to the world sit the norns weaving;
they cannot alter what ordained is.
but i would fain be taught of thy wisdom how a wheel on the roll can be stayed
erba
dark
and troubled my mind grows through men's deeds.
a god once subdued the wala's self to his will.
a wish-maiden i bore to wotan;
from fields of battle she brought him slain heroes;
bold is she and wise to boot:
why waken me?
why seek not counsel from erda's
and wotan's child
wanderer
the valkyrie, brünnhild'?
meanest thou her?
she flouted the storm-controller, when,
sorely urged, himself he controlled.
what the swayer
and lord of battles longed for,
what he refrained from against his desire,
brünnhilde, bold, rash, over-confident,
when the fight was at fiercest,
strove for herself to perform.
war-father punished the maid:
he pressed slumber into her eyes,
on the flame-girt rock she sleeps.
the hallowed maid will waken alone,
that she may love and wed with a man.
small hope of answer from her
erba
dazed have i felt since i woke;
wild, confused seems the world!
the valkyrie, the wala's child,
bound lay, fettered by sleep,
while her all-knowing mother slept!
does revolt's teacher chide revolt?
does the deed he urged to anger him, done?
he who guards the right,
to whom vows are sacred,
hinders the right?
reigns through falsehood?
let me down to the dark,
that my wisdom may slumber
wanderer
i will not let thee descend,
for a potent magic i wield.
all-wise one,
planted by thee the sting of care was in wotan's dauntless heart;
for, through thy wisdom,
downfall
and shameful doom were foretold him;
my mind was fettered by fear.
now let the world's wisest of women answer
and say how a god may conquer his care
erba
thou art not what thou hast said.
why art thou come, wild and wayward,
to trouble the wala's sleep
wanderer
thou art not what thou hast dreamed.
thy end draws near, mother of wisdom;
thy wisdom at war with me shall perish.
knowest thou wotan's will
a long silence
i tell thee
that thou mayest sleep for evermore unvexed by care.
that the gods are doomed,
no longer dismays me, since i will it so.
what, with myself at war, in anguish,
despairing, once i resolved, gaily,
gladly, with delight i now do.
mad with disgust i decreed once the world to the nibelung's hate,
but now to the valiant wälsung i leave it with joy.
one who never knew me,
though chosen by me,
a boy bold and fearless,
helped not by wotan,
has won the nibelung's ring.
blest in love, void of all envy,
on him shall fall harmless alberich's curse,
for no fear does he know.
soon thy child and mine, brünnhild',
shall be waked by him;
and when waked our child shall achieve a deed to redeem the world.
so slumber again, closing thine eyelids;
dreaming behold my downfall!
whatever comes after,
the god rejoicing yields to youth ever young.
descend, then, erda, mother of fear!
world-sorrow!
descend!
descend!
and sleep for aye
erda, whose eyes are already closed,
and who has gradually been sinking deeper,
disappears entirely.
the cavern has become quite dark again
dawn lights up the stage;
the storm has ceased.
the wanderer has gone close to the cave,
and leans with his back against it,
facing the wings
wanderer
lo!
yonder siegfried comes
he remains where he is without changing his position.
siegfried's wood-bird flutters towards the foreground.
suddenly the bird stops in his direct flight,
flutters to and fro in alarm,
and disappears quickly towards the back
enters and stops
my bird has vanished from sight!
with fluttering wings
and lovely song blithely he showed me the way,
and then forsook me and fled!
i must discover the rock for myself:
the path i followed so far 'twere best still to pursue
he goes towards the back
still in the same position
boy, pray tell me, whither away
halts and turns round
did some one speak?
perhaps he knows the road
he goes nearer to the wanderer
i would find a rock
that by flaming fire is surrounded:
there sleeps a maid whom i would awake
wanderer
who bade thee seek this rock flame-circled?
taught thee to yearn for the woman
siegfried
it was a singing woodland bird;
he gave me welcome tidings
wanderer
a wood-bird chatters idly what no man understands;
how then couldst thou tell the song's true meaning
siegfried
because of the blood of a dragon grim
that fell before me at neidhöhl'
the burning blood had scarce touched my tongue when the sense of the singer grew plain
wanderer
who was it urged thee on to try thy strength,
and slay this dragon so dread
siegfried
my guide was mime, a faithless dwarf:
what fear is fain he had taught me.
but 'twas the dragon roused me himself,
wrathful, to strike the blow;
for he threatened me with his jaws
wanderer
who forged the sword so hard
and keen that it slew the daunting foe
siegfried
i forged it myself when the smith was beaten;
swordless else i should have been still
wanderer
but who made the mighty splinters from which the sword was welded strong
siegfried
what know i of that?
i only know
that the splintered steel was useless were not the sword forged anew
wanderer
bursts out laughing with gleeful good-humour
i fully agree
surprised
at what dost thou laugh?
prying greybeard!
prithee have done;
keep me no longer here talking.
speak if thou knowest whither my way lies;
and hold thy tongue unless thou canst tell
wanderer
good boy, have patience!
if i seem old,
more need to show me due honour
siegfried
what an odd notion!
my whole life long a hateful old man has blocked my pathway;
him i at last swept aside.
standest thou longer trying here to stay me,
i warn thee frankly
with a significant gesture
that thou like mime shalt fare
he goes still nearer to the wanderer
but what art thou like?
why wearest thou such a monstrous hat,
and why hangs it so over thy face
still without altering his position
that is the way i wear it when against the wind i go
inspecting him still more closely
but an eye beneath it is wanting.
perchance by some one whose way thou didst too boldly bar it has been struck out.
take thyself off,
or else very soon the other thou shalt lose also
wanderer
i see, my son, where thou art blind,
and hence thy jaunty assurance.
with the eye
that is amissing in me thou lookest now on the other
that still is left me for sight
siegfried
who has been listening thoughtfully,
now bursts involuntarily into hearty laughter
thy foolish talk sets me laughing!
but come, this nonsense must finish.
at once show me my way;
then proceed thou too on thine own;
for me further use thou hast none:
so speak, or off thou shalt pack
gently
child, didst thou know who i am,
thy scoffs i had been spared!
from one so dear,
insult hard to endure is.
long have i loved thy radiant race,
though from my fury in terror it shrank.
thou whom i love so, all too fair one,
rouse my wrath not to-day;
it would ruin both thee and me
siegfried
still art thou dumb, stubborn old man?
stand to one side, then;
that pathway, i know,
leads to the slumbering maid;
for thither the wood-bird was guiding when he flew off
it suddenly becomes dark again
wanderer
breaking out in anger
and assuming a commanding attitude
in fear of its life it fled.
it knew that here was the ravens' lord;
dire his plight were he caught!
the way that it guided thou shalt not go
siegfried
amazed,
falls hack and assumes a defiant attitude
hoho!
interferer!
who then art thou
that wilt not let me pass
wanderer
fear thou the rock's defender!
my might it is holds the maiden fettered by sleep.
he who would wake her,
he who would win her,
impotent makes me for ever
a burning sea encircles the maid,
fires fiercely glowing surround the rock;
he who craves the bride the flames must boldly defy
he points with his spear towards the rocky heights
look up above!
that light dost thou see?
the surging heat, the splendour, grows;
clouds of fire rolling,
tongues of flame writhing,
roaring and raging, come ravening down.
thy head now is flooded with light
a flickering glow,
increasing in brightness,
appears on the summit of the rock
the fire will seize thee,
seize and devour thee.
back, back, there, foolhardy boy
siegfried
stand back, old babbler, thyself!
for where the fire is burning,
to brünnhilde yonder i go
he advances;
the wanderer bars his way
wanderer
hast thou no fear of the fire,
then barred by my spear be thy path!
i still hold the haft that conquers all;
the sword thou dost wield it shivered long ago:
upon my spear eternal break it once more
he stretches out his spear
drawing his sword
'tis my father's foe, found here at last!
now, then, for vengeance!
in luck am i!
brandish thy spear:
my sword will hew it in twain
with one stroke he hews the wanderer's spear in two pieces.
lightning flashes from the spear up towards the rocks,
where the light, until now dim,
begins to flame brighter and brighter.
a violent thunder-clap,
which quickly dies away,
accompanies the stroke
wanderer
quietly picking up the pieces of the spear which have fallen at his feet
fare on!
i cannot prevent thee
he suddenly disappears in utter darkness
siegfried
with his spear in splinters vanished the coward
the growing brightness of the clouds of fire,
which keep sinking down lower and lower,
attracts siegfried's eye
ha!
rapturous fire!
glorious light!
shining my pathway opens before me.
in fiery flames plunging,
through fire i will win to the bride!
hoho!
hahei!
to summon a comrade i call
he sets his horn to his lips
and plunges into the fiery billows,
which, flowing down from the heights,
now spread over the foreground.
siegfried, who is soon lost to view,
seems, from the sound of his horn,
to be ascending the mountain.
the flames begin to fade,
and change gradually into a dissolving cloud lit by the glow of dawn
the thin cloud has resolved itself into a fine rose-coloured veil of mist,
which so divides
that the upper part rises
and disappears,
disclosing the bright blue sky of day;
whilst on the edge of the rocky height,
now becoming visible (exactly the same scene as in the third act of "the valkyrie"),
a veil of mist reddened by the dawn remains hanging,
which suggests the magic fire still flaming below.
the arrangement of the scene is exactly the same as at the end of "the valkyrie.
in the foreground,
under a wide-spreading fir-tree,
lies brünnhilde in full shining armour,
her helmet on her head,
and her long shield covering her,
in deep sleep
siegfried
coming from the back,
reaches the rocky edge of the summit,
and at first shows only the upper part of his body.
he looks round him for a longtime in amaze.
softly
solitude blissful on sun-caressed height
he climbs to the summit, and,
standing on a rock at the edge of the precipice at the back,
gazes at the scene in astonishment.
he looks into the wood at the side
and comes forward a little
what lies in shadow, asleep in the wood?
a charger resting in slumber deep
approaching slowly he stops in surprise when,
still at some little distance from her,
he sees brünnhilde
what radiant thing lies yonder
the steel, how it gleams and glints!
is it the glare that dazzles me still?
shining armour?
shall it be mine
he lifts up the shield
and sees brünnhilde's form;
her face, however,
is for the most part hidden by her helmet
ha!
it covers a man!
the sight stirs thoughts sweet
and strange!
the helm must lie hard on his head;
lighter lay he were it unloosed
he loosens the helmet carefully
and removes it from the head of the sleeper.
long curling hair breaks forth.
tenderly
ah!
how fair
he stands lost in contemplation
clouds gleaming softly fringe with their fleeces this lake of heaven bright;
laughing,
the glorious face of the sun shines through the billowy clouds
he bends lower over the sleeper
his bosom is heaving,
stirred by his breath;
ought i to loosen the breastplate
he tries to loosen the breastplate
come, my sword, cleave thou the iron
he draws his sword and gently
and carefully cuts through the rings on both sides of the breastplate;
he then lifts this off along with the greaves,
so
that brünnhilde now lies before him in a soft woman's robe.
he draws back startled and amazed
that is no man
he stares at the sleeper, greatly excited
magical rapture pierces my heart;
fixed is my gaze, burning with terror;
i reel, my heart faints and fails
he is seized with sudden terror.
magical rapture pierces my heart;
fixed is my gaze, burning with terror;
i reel, my heart faints and fails
on whom shall i call, for aid imploring?
mother!
mother!
remember me
he sinks as if fainting on to brünnhilde's bosom;
then he starts up sighing
how waken the maid,
causing her eyelids to open
tenderly
her eyelids to open?
what if her gaze strike me blind!
how shall i dare to look on their light?
all rocks and sways and swirls
and revolves;
uttermost longing burns and consumes me;
my hand on my heart,
it trembles and shakes!
what ails thee, coward?
is this what fear means?
o mother!
mother!
thy dauntless child
very tenderly
a woman lying asleep has taught him what fear is at last!
how conquer my fear?
how brace my heart?
that, myself, i waken,
i must waken the sleeper
as he approaches the sleeping figure again he is overcome by tenderer emotions at the light.
he bends down lower;
sweetly
softly quivers her flower-sweet mouth!
its lovely trembling has charmed my despair!
ah!
and the fragrant,
blissful warmth of her breath
as if in despair
awaken!
awaken, maiden divine
he gazes at her
she hears me not.
new life from the sweetest of lips i will suck,
then, even though kissing i die
he sinks, as if dying,
on to the sleeping figure, and,
closing his eyes,
fastens his lips on brünnhilde's.
brünnhilde opens her eyes.
siegfried starts up,
and remains standing before her
brünnhilde
rises slowly to a sitting posture.
raising her arms,
she greets the earth
and sky with solemn gestures on her return to consciousness
sun, i hail thee!
hail, o light!
hail, o glorious day.
long i have slept;
i am awake.
what hero broke brünnhilde's sleep
siegfried
awed and entranced by her look
and her voice,
stands as if spellbound
through the fierce fires flaming round this rock i burst;
i unloosened thy helmet strong:
i awoke thee.
siegfried am i
sitting upright
gods, i hail you!
hail, o world!
hail, o earth, in thy glory!
my sleep is over now, my eyes open.
it is siegfried who bids me wake
sun, i hail thee!
hail, o light!
hail, o glorious day
siegfried
breaking forth in rapturous exaltation
i hail thee, mother who gave me birth!
hail, o earth,
that nourished my life so
that i see those eyes beam on me,
blest among men
brünnhilde
i hail the mother who gave thee birth!
hail, o earth, that nourished thy life!
no eye dared see me but thine;
to thee alone might i wake
both remain full of beaming ecstasy,
lost in mutual contemplation
brünnhilde
o siegfried!
siegfried!
hero most blest!
of life the awaker, conquering light!
o joy of the world,
couldst know how thou wert always loved!
thou wert my gladness, my care wert thou!
thy life i sheltered before it was thine;
my shield was thy shelter ere thou wert born:
so long loved wert thou, siegfried
softly and timidly
my mother did not die, then?
did the dear one but sleep
brünnhilde
smiles
and stretches her hand out kindly towards him
adorable child!
nevermore thy mother will greet thee!
thyself am i,
if i be blest with thy love.
all things i know known not to thee;
yet only of my love born is my wisdom
o siegfried!
siegfried!
conquering light!
i loved thee always,
for i alone divined the thought hid by wotan:
hidden thought i dared not so much as utter;
thought that i thought not,
feeling it only;
for which i worked, battled and strove,
defying even him who conceived it;
for which in penance prisoned i lay,
because thought it was not,
but felt alone!
for what the thought was-- say,
canst thou guess it?
was love of thee, nothing but that
siegfried
how wondrous sounds thy rapturous song!
but dark the meaning to me
tenderly
of thine eyes the splendour i see plain,
i can feel thee breathing soft and warm,
sweet can hear the singing of thy voice,
but what thou sayest i strive vainly to understand.
i cannot grasp clearly things so far distant;
needed is every sense to feel
and behold thee!
by laming fear fettered am i,
for how to fear thou hast taught me at last;
thou who hast bound me in bonds of such power,
give me my courage again
he remains in great excitement with his yearning gaze fixed on her
brünnhilde
turns her head gently aside
and looks towards the wood
i see there grane, my sacred horse;
in gladness he grazes who slept with me!
he too has by siegfried been waked
siegfried
without changing his position
my gaze on a mouth most lovely is feasting;
my lips are afire with passionate yearning for the pasture sweet
that i look on
brünnhilde
points to her armour,
which she now perceives
i see there the shield
that sheltered heroes;
and there is the helmet that hid my head:
it shields, it hides me no more
with fire
by a glorious maid my heart has been hurt wounds in my head a woman has struck:
i came without shield or helm
with increased sadness
i see there the breastplate's glittering steel;
a keen-edged sword sundered the rings,
from the form of the maiden loosened the mail:
nor shelter nor shield is left to the weak
and sorrowful maid
with heat
through billows of fire i battled to thee,
no buckler or breastplate sheltered or screened;
the flames have won their way to my heart;
my blood hot-surging rushes and leaps;
a ravening fire is kindled within me:
the flames
that shone round brünnhilde's rock are burning now in my breast!
o maid, extinguish the fire!
calm the commotion and rage
he has embraced her passionately
brünnhilde
springs up,
resists him with the utmost strength of terror,
and flies to the other side of the stage
no god's touch have i known!
with awe the heroes greeted the maiden:
holy came she from walhall.
woe's me!
woe's me!
woe the affront, the bitter disgrace!
he wounds me sore who waked me from sleep!
he has broken breastplate and helm;
now i am brünnhild' no more
siegfried
thou art to me the dreaming maid still;
brünnhilde lies lapped still in sleep.
awake, be a woman to me
bewildered
confused are my senses, my mind is blank:
wisdom, dost thou forsake me
siegfried
said not thy song thy wisdom drew its light from thy love of me
staring before her
shadows drear-falling darken my gaze;
mine eyes see dimly, the light dies out,
deep is the dark.
from dread-haunted mists fear in a frenzy comes writhing forth;
terror stalks me
and grows with each stride
she hides her eyes with her hands in violent terror
siegfried
gently removing her hands from her eyes
dread lies dark on eyelids bound;
with the fetters vanish the fear
and gloom;
rise from the dark and behold:
bright as the sun is the day
much agitated
flaunting my shame,
bright as the sun shines the day!
o siegfried!
siegfried!
pity my woe!
i have always lived
and shall live-- always in sweet,
rapturous yearning,
and always to make thee blest
o siegfried!
glorious wealth of the world!
laughing hero!
life of the earth!
ah, forbear!
leave me in peace!
touch me not, mad with delirious frenzy!
break me not,
bring me not under thy yoke,
undo not the loved one so dear
hast thou rejoiced thyself to see reflected clear in the stream?
if into wavelets the water were stirred,
and ruffled the limpid calm of the brook,
thy face would not be there,
only water's rippling unrest.
so untouched let me stay, trouble me not,
and thy face mirrored bright in me will smile to thee always,
gay and merry and glad!
o siegfried, radiant child,
love thyself and leave me in peace;
o bring not thine own to naught
siegfried
i love thee;
didst thou but love me!
myself i have lost;
ah, would thou wert won!
a fair-flowing flood before me rolls;
with all my senses nothing i see but buoyant,
beautiful billows.
if it refuse to mirror my face,
just as i am, to assuage my fever,
myself i will plunge straight in the stream:
if only the billows would blissfully drown me,
my yearning lost in the flood!
awaken, brünnhilde!
waken, o maid!
laughing and living, sweetest delight,
be mine!
be mine!
be mine
with deep feeling
thine, siegfried!
i was from of old
with fire
what thou hast been that be thou still
brünnhilde
thine i will always be
siegfried
what thou wilt be be thou to-day!
clasped in my arms and closely embraced,
heart upon heart beating in rapture,
glances aglow,
and breath mingled hungrily,
eye in eye and mouth on mouth!
all that thou wert and wilt be,
be thou it now!
the fear
and the fever would vanish were brünnhild' now mine
brünnhilde
were i now thine
heavenly calm is tossing and raging;
light that was pure flames into passion;
wisdom divine forsakes me and flies;
jubilant love has scared it away
if i be thine?
siegfried!
siegfried!
canst thou not see?
by the blaze of my eyes thou art not struck blind?
in my arms' embrace thou surely must burn!
as my blood like a torrent surges
and leaps,
the fire fierce-flaming dost thou not feel?
fearest thou, siegfried?
fearest thou not the wild,
love-frenzied maid
with a shock of joy
ha!
as the blood swift-surging is kindled,
as our eyes devour one another,
as our arms cling close in their rapture,
dauntless again my courage swells,
and the fear i failed for so long to learn,
the fear
that i scarcely learned from thee
the stupid boy fears
that fear is completely forgot
with the last words he has involuntarily let brünnhilde go
laughing wildly with joy
oh, valorous boy!
oh, glorious hero!
unwitting source of wonderful deeds!
laughing, laughing i love thee;
laughing welcome my blindness;
laughing let us go doomwards,
laughing go down to death
farewell walhall's radiant world,
its stately halls in the dust laid low!
farewell, glittering pomp divine!
end in bliss, o immortal race!
norns, rend in sunder your rope of runes!
dusk steal darkly over the gods!
night of their downfall dimly descend!
now siegfried's star is rising for me;
he is for ever and for aye, my wealth,
my world, my all in all:
love ever radiant, laughing death
siegfried
while brünnhilde repeats the foregoing,
beginning at "farewell walhall's radiant world.
laughing thou wakest, thou my delight!
brünnhilde lives, brünnhilde laughs!
hail, o day in glory arisen!
hail, o sun that shines from on high!
hail, o light from the darkness sprung!
hail, o world where brünnhilde dwells!
she wakes!
she lives!
she greets me with laughter!
splendour streams from brünnhilde's star
siegfried
she is for ever and for aye my wealth,
my world, my all in all,
love ever radiant, laughing death
brünnhilde throws herself into siegfried's arms.
the curtain falls
the twilight of the gods
the first norn
what light glimmers there
the second norn
is it already dawn
the third norn
loge's host glows in flame around the rock.
it is night.
why spin we not, singing the while
to the first
where for our spinning
and singing wilt thou fasten the rope
the first norn
while she loosens a golden rope from herself
and ties one end of it to a branch of the pine-tree
i sing and wind the rope badly or well,
as may be.
at the world-ash-tree once i wove,
when from the stem there bourgeoned strong the boughs of a sacred wood.
in the shadows cool a fountain flowed;
wisdom whispered low from its wave;
of holy things i sang.
a dauntless god came to drink at the well;
for the draught he drank he paid with the loss of an eye.
from the world-ash-tree wotan broke a holy bough;
from the bough he cut
and shaped the shaft of a spear
as time rolled on the wood wasted
and died of the wound;
sere, leafless and barren,
wan withered the tree;
sadly the flow of the fountain failed;
troubled grew my sorrowful song.
and now no more at the world-ash-tree i weave;
i needs must fasten here on the pine-tree my rope.
sing,
o sister-- catch as i throw
canst thou tell us why
the second norn
winds the rope thrown to her round a projecting rock at the entrance of the cave
runes of treaties well weighed
and pondered cut were by wotan in the shaft,
which wielding, he swayed the world.
a hero bold in fight then splintered the spear,
the hallowed haft with its treaties cleaving in twain.
then bade wotan walhall's heroes hew down the world-ash-tree forthwith,
both the stem and boughs sere and barren.
the ash-tree sank;
sealed was the fountain that flowed.
round the sharp edge of the rock i wind the rope:
sing, o sister, catch as i throw;
further canst thou tell
the third norn
catching the rope
and throwing the end behind her
the castle stands by giants up reared.
with the gods
and the holy host of the heroes wotan sits in his hall;
and round the walls hewn logs are heaped,
high up-piled, ready for burning:
the world-ash-tree these were once.
when the wood flares up brightly
and burns,
in its fire shall the fair hall be consumed.
and then shall the high gods' downfall dawn in darkness for aye.
know ye yet more,
begin anew winding the rope;
again i throw it back from the north.
spin and sing, o my sister
she throws the rope to the second norn
and the second throws it to the first,
who loosens the rope from the bough
and ties it on to another
the first norn
looking towards the back
is it the dawn,
or the firelight that flickers?
grief-darkened is my gaze.
the holy past i can scarce remember,
when loge burst of old into burning fire.
dost thou know how he fared
the second norn
winding the rope which has been thrown to her round the rock again
overcome by wotan's spear and its magic,
loge worked for the god;
then, to win his freedom,
gnawed with his tooth the solemn runes on the shaft.
so with the potent spell of the spear-point wotan confined him flaming where brünnhilde slumbered.
canst thou tell us the end
the third norn
with the broken spear's sharp-piercing splinters wotan wounded the blazing one deep in the breast;
ravening fire springs from the wound,
and this is thrown 'mid the world-ash-tree's hewn logs heaped ready for burning.
would ye know when that will be, wind,
o sisters, the rope
she throws the rope back;
the second norn winds it up
and throws it again to the first
the first norn
fastening the rope again
the night wanes, dark grows my vision;
i cannot find the threads of the rope;
the strands are twisted and loose.
a horrible sight wildly vexes mine eyes:
rhinegold that black alberich stole.
knowest thou more thereof
the second norn
with laborious haste winds the rope round the jagged rock at the mouth of the cave
the rock's sharp edge is cutting the rope;
the threads loosen their hold
and grow slack;
they droop tangled and frayed.
from woe
and wrath rises the nibelung's ring;
a curse of revenge ruthlessly gnaws at the strands:
canst thou the end foretell
the third norn
hastily catching the rope which is thrown to her
the rope is too short, too loose it hangs;
it must be stretched, pulled straighter,
before its end can reach to the north
she pulls hard at the rope, which breaks
it breaks
the second norn
it breaks
the first norn
it breaks
they take the pieces of broken rope
and bind their bodies together with them
the three norns
so ends wisdom eternal!
the wise ones will utter no more.
descend to erda!
descend
they vanish.
the dawn grows brighter;
the firelight from the valley gradually fades.
sunrise;
then broad daylight
siegfried
and brünnhilde enter from the cave.
he is fully armed;
she leads her horse by the bridle
brünnhilde
belovèd hero,
poor my love were wert thou thereby kept from new deeds.
one single doubt yet makes me linger:
the fear my service has been too small.
the things the gods taught me i could give:
all the rich hoard of holy runes;
but by the hero who holds my heart i have been robbed of my maiden valour.
in wisdom weak, although strong in will;
in love so rich,
in power so poor
must thou not scorn her lack of riches who,
though so eager, can give nothing more
the norns vanish
siegfried
wonderful woman,
more thy gifts than i can guard!
o chide not if thy teaching has left me still untaught
with fire
that brünnhilde lives for me
to that lore i hold fast;
and one lesson i have learned
brünnhilde to remember
brünnhilde
if thou wouldst truly love me,
think of thyself alone,
and of thy deeds of daring!
the raging fire remember
that fearless thou didst fare through when around the rock it burned
siegfried
that i might conquer brünnhild'
brünnhilde
think too of the shield-hidden maid thou didst find there lapped in slumber.
and whose helmet hard thou didst break--
siegfried
brünnhilde to awaken
brünnhilde
those oaths remember that unite us;
the faith and truth that are between us,
and evermore the love we live for;
brünnhilde in thy breast will deeply burn then for aye
she embraces siegfried
siegfried
must i leave thee, o love,
in thy holy fortress of fire
he has taken alberich's ring from his finger,
and holds it out to brünnhilde
this ring of mine i give thee;
let it pay for thy runes.
of whatever deeds i did the virtue lies therein.
by my hand was the dragon grim,
who long had guarded it, slain;
keep thou the gold
and its might as token true of my love
brünnhilde
putting on the ring in rapturous delight
i covet it more than all else!
for the ring take grane, my horse.
through the air with me he galloped once boldly,
but lost with mine was his magic art;
upon clouds and storm,
through thunder
and lightning no more gallantly now will he sweep!
but if thou lead the way,
even through fire fearlessly grane will follow.
for henceforth, hero, thou art his master!
entreat him well;
he knows thy voice;
o, greet him often in brünnhilde's name
siegfried
then every deed
that i dare will be achieved through thy virtue all my battles thou wilt choose,
and my victories will be thine.
upon thy good horse riding,
and sheltered by thy shield,
no longer siegfried am i,
but only brünnhilde's arm
siegfried leaves brünnhilde in search of adventure
brünnhilde
o were but brünnhilde thy soul too
siegfried
through her my courage burns high
brünnhilde
then wert thou siegfried and brünnhild'
siegfried
where i am, there thy abode is
with animation
then a waste is my hall of rock
siegfried
made one, both there abide
greatly moved
ye gods, o ye holy race of immortals,
feast ye your eyes on this love-hallowed pair!
apart--who shall divide us?
divided--still we are one
siegfried
hail, o brünnhilde, beautiful star!
hail, love and its glory
brünnhilde
hail, o siegfried, conquering light!
hail, life and its glory!
hail, conquering light
both
hail!
hail!
hail!
hail
siegfried leads the horse quickly to the edge of the sloping rock,
brünnhilde following him.
siegfried disappears with the horse down behind the projecting rock,
so
that he is no longer visible to the audience.
brünnhilde is thus suddenly left standing alone on the edge of the slope,
and gazes down into the valley after siegfried.
her gestures show
that siegfried has vanished from her sight.
siegfried's horn is heard from below.
brünnhilde listens,
and steps further out on the slope.
she catches sight of siegfried in the valley again,
and waves to him joyfully.
her happy smiles seem to reflect the air of the merrily departing hero
the first act
the hall of the gibichungs on the rhine.
this is quite open at the back.
an open shore stretching to the river occupies the background.
rocky heights enclose the shore.
gunther
and gutrune on a throne at one side,
before which stands a table with drinking-vessels on it.
in front of this hagen is seated
gunther
give ear, hagen;
tell me the truth:
is my fame on the rhine worthy of gibich's son
hagen
i envy thee thy fame and thy glory;
thy great renown was foretold to me by grimhild' our mother
gunther
i envy thee, so envy not me.
i, as first-born, rule,
but the wisdom is thine.
half-brother's feud could scarce be laid better;
asking thus of my renown,
'tis thy wisdom that i praise
hagen
my words i withdraw,
thy fame might be more:
i know of precious treasures
that the gibichung has not yet won
gunther
hide these, and i withdraw my praise
hagen
in summer's full-ripened glory blooms the gibich stock,
thou, gunther, still unwived, thou,
gutrun, still unwed
gunther
whom wouldst thou have me woo,
to win more wide renown
hagen
one i know of, none nobler in the world.
she dwells on soaring rocks,
her chamber is circled by fire;
and he who would brünnhild' woo must break through the daunting flame
gunther
suffices my strength for the task
hagen
for one stronger still it is decreed
gunther
who is that hero unmatched
hagen
siegfried, the wälsung's son;
he is the hero bold.
a twin-born pair,
whom fate turned to lovers,
siegmund and sieglinde,
had as their offspring this child.
in the woods he grew and waxed strong.
'tis he that gutrun must wed
shyly
tell me what deed of high valour made this hero the first in renown
hagen
at neidhöhle a huge dragon lay,
who guarded the nibelung's gold.
he was slain,
and his horrid jaws closed by siegfried's invincible sword.
from this colossal deed the fame of the hero dawned
thoughtfully
they say
that a priceless treasure the niblungs had in their hoard
hagen
the man who could use its spell were lord of the world evermore
gunther
and siegfried won it in fight
hagen
he has the niblungs in thrall
gunther
and brünnhild' no other can win
hagen
to no other will the flames yield
rises angrily from his seat
why wake dissension and doubt?
why stir up my desire
and yearning for joys that cannot be won
he walks to and fro much agitated
hagen
without leaving his seat causes gunther to pull up as he approaches him,
by a gesture of mysterious import
would not brünnhilde be thy bride,
were she by siegfried brought home
gunther
turns away doubtful and angry
but how could i force this man to woo the bride for me
as before
thy simple prayer would force him,
gutrun winning him first
gutrune
thou mockest, cruel hagen!
what arts have i to bind him?
the greatest hero in all the world has long ere this by the fairest women on earth been loved
hagen
bending confidentially towards gutrune
what of the drink in the chest
more secretly
in me who won it have more faith.
to thee in love it will bind him whom thy heart most desires
gunther has come to the table again, and,
leaning against it, pays close attention
hither did siegfried come,
and taste of this potion of herbs,
he would straight forget he had looked on any woman before,
or been by woman approached.
now answer:
think ye my counsel good
starting up suddenly
now grimhild' be praised,
who for brother gave us thee
gutrune
siegfried fain i would behold
gunther
but how can he be found
a horn on the stage,
from the background on the left,
very loud but distant
hagen
listens and turns to gunther
merrily hunting after renown across the world as through a wood,
belike in his chase he will come,
to the gibich's realm on the rhine
gunther
heartily welcome were he
a horn on the stage, nearer,
but still distant.
both listen
a horn from the rhine i hear
hagen
looks down the river
and calls towards the back
a man and horse on board a boat!
his horn how gaily he winds
a horn on the stage sounds nearer.
gunther stops half-way listening
see the leisurely stroke,
and the indolent arm against the stream urging the boat!
so skilful a hand on the swinging oar can be but his who the dragon slew:
it is siegfried--surely no other
gunther
will he go by
hagen
making a trumpet of his hands,
calls towards the river
hoiho!
blithe hero, whither bound
from the distance
i seek the son of gibich
hagen
i bid thee welcome to gunther's hall
siegfried in a boat appears at the shore
this way!
stop here and land
siegfried brings his boat to the shore.
hagen makes it fast with the chain.
siegfried springs ashore with his horse.
gunther has come down and joined hagen
hagen
hail, siegfried, hero bold
gutrune gazes at siegfried from the throne in astonishment.
gunther prepares to offer him friendly greetings.
all stand fixed in silent mutual contemplation
siegfried
leaning on his horse,
remains quietly standing by the boat
who is gibich's son
gunther
i am he thou dost seek
siegfried
thy fame has reached me from the rhine;
now fight with me, or be my friend
gunther
be thou mine;
thou art welcome
siegfried
where stable my horse
hagen
leave him to me
turning to hagen
my name thou knowest;
where have we met
hagen
i guessed from thy strength who thou must be
siegfried
as he hands over the horse to hagen
be careful of grane,
for thou hast never led by the rein so noble a steed
hagen leads the horse away.
while siegfried looks thoughtfully after him,
gutrune,
obeying a sign of hagen's which siegfried does not notice,
goes to her room through a door on the left.
gunther comes into the hall with siegfried,
whom he has invited to accompany him
gunther
my father's ancient hall, o hero,
greet in gladness!
all thou beholdest, where'er thou art,
treat as thine own henceforward:
thine is my kingdom-- land and folk;
by my body i swear it!
yea, myself i am thine
siegfried
nor land nor folk have i to give,
nor father's house nor hall;
in my body is all my wealth;
as i live it grows less.
but a sword have i which i welded;
let my sword be my witness!
that and myself i bestow
hagen
who has come back
and now stands behind siegfried
of the nibelungs' treasure rumour names thee the lord
siegfried
turning round to hagen
i almost forgot the hoard,
so lightly i prize its worth.
i left it lying in a cavern,
where a dragon once held watch
hagen
and nothing took at all
siegfried
only this, not knowing its use
hagen
it is the tarnhelm,
the gem of the nibelung's art;
its use, when worn on thy head,
is to change thy shape as thou wilt;
if fain to be borne afar, in a flash lo!
thou art there!
didst thou take nothing besides
siegfried
yes, a ring
hagen
which safe thou dost hold
tenderly
'tis held by a woman fair
aside
brünnhild'
gunther
nay, siegfried, let us not barter;
all i have a bauble poor,
matched with thy treasure, would be.
i will serve thee without reward
hagen has gone to gutrune's door,
and now opens it
gutrune
enters carrying a full drinking-horn,
with which she approaches siegfried
welcome, o guest, to gibich's house!
'tis his daughter gives thee to drink
siegfried
bows in a friendly manner
and takes the horn,
which he holds thoughtfully before him
were all forgot thou gavest to me,
one lesson i will never forget;
so this first draught with love undying,
brünnhild', i drink to thee
he puts the drinking-horn to his lips
and takes a long draught;
then he hands it back to gutrune, who,
ashamed
and confused, casts down her eyes.
siegfried gazes at her with sudden passion
siegfried
o thou who dost scorch
and blind with thine eyes,
why sink them abashed by my gaze
gutrune, blushing, looks up at him
o lovely maid, lower thine eyes;
my heart is aflame, burnt by their light;
they kindle my blood;
it flows in devouring torrents of fire
with a trembling voice
gunther, what name is thy sister's
gunther
gutrune
softly
can those be good runes
that in her eyes i am reading
he ardently seizes gutrune's hand
with thy brother i was fain to serve;
his pride my prayer scorned.
were i to pray the same of thee,
wouldst thou like him be proud
gutrune involuntarily meets hagen's eye.
she bows her head humbly, and,
expressing her feeling of unworthiness with a gesture,
leaves the hall with faltering steps
siegfried
attentively watched by hagen and gunther,
gazes after gutrune as if entranced
gunther, hast thou a wife
gunther
i am not wed, nor, it would seem,
likely to find a wife!
my heart on one i have set whom there is no way to win
siegfried
turns with animation to gunther
in what canst thou fail with me for friend
gunther
on rocky heights her home;
surrounded by fire her hall
siegfried
interrupting in wondering haste
on rocky heights her home;
surrounded by fire her hall".
gunther
he only who braves the fire
siegfried
as if making an intense effort to remember something
he only who braves the fire".
siegfried hands the drinking-horn back to gutrune,
and gazes at her with sudden passion
gunther
may brünnhilde's wooer be
siegfried shows by a gesture
that at the mention of brünnhilde's name all remembrance of her has faded
i dare not essay the dread mountain;
the flames would not fall for me
siegfried
awakes from his dreamy state,
and turns to gunther high-spirited
and gay
for thee i will win her,
of fire i have no fear;
for thy man am i,
and my strength is thine,
if gutrun i win as my wife
gunther
gutrune gladly i grant thee
siegfried
thou shalt have brünnhilde then
gunther
but how wilt deceive her
siegfried
i will wear the tarnhelm
and appear in thy form
gunther
then let the oath now be sworn
siegfried
blood-brotherhood sworn be by oath
hagen fills a drinking-horn with fresh wine;
he holds it out to siegfried and gunther,
who cut their arms with their swords
and hold them for a short pace over the horn;
then they each lay two fingers on the horn,
which hagen continues to hold between them
siegfried and gunther
quickening blood of blossoming life lo!
i drop in the horn!
bravely mixed in brotherly love,
bloom our blood in the draught!
troth i drink to the friend glad
and free to-day from the bond blood-brotherhood spring!
but if broken the bond,
or if faithless the friend,
what in drops to-day we drink kindly in torrents wildly shall flow,
paying treachery's wage.
so--sealed be the bond!
so--pledged be my faith
gunther drinks
and hands the horn to siegfried,
who finishes the draught,
and holds out the empty horn to hagen.
hagen breaks the horn in two with his sword.
gunther and siegfried join hands
siegfried
observes hagen, who,
while the oat was being sworn,
has stood behind him
why hast not thou plighted thy troth
hagen
my blood had soured the good draught.
it flows not pure and noble like yours;
stubborn and cold, slow it runs,
my cheek refusing to redden.
i hold aloof from hot-blooded bonds
to siegfried
heed not him and his spleen
siegfried
puts on his shield again
up, then, and off!
back to the boat!
sail swift to the mountain
he steps nearer to gunther
and points at him
by the bank one night on board thou shalt tarry,
and then bring home the bride
he turns to go,
and beckons gunther to follow him
gunther
wilt thou not rest awhile
siegfried
i am eager to be back
he goes to the shore to unmoor the boat
gunther
thou, hagen, keep guard o'er the homestead
he follows siegfried to the shore.
whilst siegfried and gunther,
after laying their arms in the boat,
are hoisting the sail
and making ready for departure,
hagen takes up his spear and shield.
gutrune appears at the door of her chamber just as siegfried is pushing off the boat,
which immediately glides into the middle of the stream
gutrune
so swiftly whither haste they
hagen
while he seats himself comfortably with shield
and spear in front of the hall
to woo brünnhild' for bride
gutrune
siegfried
hagen
see how he hastes,
for wife seeking to win thee
gutrune
siegfried--mine
she returns to her room greatly excited.
siegfried has seized an oar
and rows the boat down-stream,
so that it is soon lost to view
hagen
sits motionless,
his back against the door-post of the hall
on guard here i sit watching the house,
warding the hall from the foe:
gibich's son is sped by the wind,
and sails away for a wife;
a hero bold of the helm has charge,
and danger braves for his sake;
his bride once loved he brings to the rhine;
with her he brings me--the ring.
o merry comrades, freeborn and honoured,
gaily speed on in your pride!
base though ye deem him,
the niblung's son shall yet be your lord
a curtain which frames the front of the hall is drawn,
and cuts the stage off from the audience
the curtain is raised again.
the rocky height as in the prelude.
brünnhilde sits at the entrance to the cave in silent contemplation of siegfried's ring.
moved by blissful memories,
she covers the ring with kisses.
distant thunder is heard;
she looks up and listens.
she turns to the ring again.
a flash of lightning.
again she listens,
and looks into the distance,
whence a dark thunder-cloud is approaching the rock
brünnhilde
on my ear from afar falls an old sound familiar.
a horse comes flying swift through the air;
on the clouds it sweeps in storm to the rock.
who seeks the lonely one here
from the distance
brünnhilde, sister, wake if thou sleepest
brünnhilde kisses the ring
that siegfried has left with her
starts from her seat
waltraute's call!
how welcome the sound
calling to the wing,
and then hastening to the edge of the rock
dost thou, sister,
boldly swinging come this way?
in the wood-- still dear to thee-- halt
and dismount,
and leave thy courser to rest
she runs into the wood,
from which a loud sound like a thunder-clap is heard.
she returns in great agitation with waltraute,
and remains joyfully excited without noticing the latter's anxious fear
art thou so bold
that thou art come brünnhild' to greet,
thy love unconquered by dread
waltraute
thou alone art cause of my haste
waltraute
for brünnhild's sake war-father's ban hast thou thus bravely broken?
or perchance--o say!
with some hesitation
has he at last softened to his child?
when against the god i sought to shield siegmund,
vainly--i know it
my deed fulfilled his desire.
and i know that his anger was assuaged,
for albeit in slumber deep here to the rock i was bound,
doomed to be thrall to the man who should wake the maid as he passed,
to my anguished prayer he granted grace;
with ravening fire he surrounded the rock,
to bar to all cowards the road.
bane
and chastisement turned so to blessing;
a hero unmatched has won me as wife;
blest by his love,
in light and laughter i live
she embraces waltraute with wild manifestations of joy,
which the latter tries with anxious impatience to repress
hast thou been lured by my lot,
and wouldst thou, sister,
feast on my gladness,
sharing in my delight
vehemently
sharing the frenzy
that has maddened thee,
fool!
far other the cause why i come,
defying wotan in fear
brünnhilde
here, for the first time,
notices with surprise waltraute's wildly excited state
art afraid?
anguished with terror?
so the stern one does not forgive?
thou fearest his punishing wrath
gloomily
might i but fear it,
at an end were my distress
brünnhilde
i am perplexed and amazed
waltraute
calm thou thy frenzy;
mark with care what i say!
the fear
that drove me hither to thee drives me back to walhall again
alarmed
what ails, then, the gods everlasting
waltraute
give earnest heed to what i tell thee!
since from thee wotan parted,
no more has he sent us to battle;
anxious
and bewildered we rode to the field.
shunned are walhall's bold heroes by warfather;
riding alone,
without pause or rest he wandered
and roamed through the world.
at last he returned with his spear splintered;
in his hand the pieces;
a hero had cleft it asunder.
with silent sign walhall's heroes then he sent forth to hew down the world-ash-tree.
he bade them pile the logs as they hewed them,
until they were heaped high round the hall of the blest.
the gods he next called to a council;
the high seat he solemnly took,
bidding them who gathered in fear sit beside him.
the heroes filled the hall,
ranged round in their order.
so sits he, speaks no word,
upon his high seat grave and mute,
the splintered spear held fast in his hand,
holda's apples touching no more.
fear
and amazement hold the gods fast fettered.
he has sent his ravens forth to seek tidings;
if they return
and bring him comforting news,
then the god will with soul serene smile evermore
and be glad.
round his knees in sorrow twined lie the valkyries;
he heeds not our glances beseeching;
by terror
and wild anguish we all are consumed.
against his breast weeping i nestled,
then soft grew his gaze:
he remembered, brünnhilde, thee.
he closed his eyes as if dreaming,
heavily sighed and whispered these words:
if to the deep rhine's daughters she would restore the ring
that was theirs.
from the grievous curse both god
and world were freed!
then i took thought,
and from his side through the silent ranks stole noiselessly forth.
in haste, unseen, i mounted my horse,
and stormed in tumult to thee.
grant, o sister, the boon i beg;
what thou canst do, undaunted perform!
end thou the grief of the gods
the ravens of wotan
she has thrown herself down before brünnhilde
quietly
what dreadful dream-born fancies, sad one,
are those thou dost tell?
the high gods' holy
and cloud-paved heaven is no longer my home.
i grasp not what thou art saying;
dark its sense, wild and confused.
within thine eyes, so over-weary,
gleams wavering fire;
with thy wan visage, o pale-faced sister,
what wouldst thou, wild one, of me
vehemently
the ring upon thy hand-- 'tis that:
ah, be implored!
for wotan fling it away
brünnhilde
the ring--away
waltraute
to the rhine-daughters give it again
brünnhilde
the rhine-daughters--i--the ring?
siegfried's love-pledge?
hast thou gone crazy
waltraute
hear me!
hear my despair!
on this hangs the world's undoing
and woe.
throw it from thee into the water;
end the anguish of walhall;
the accurst thing cast in the waves
brünnhilde
ha!
dost thou know what 'twould mean how shouldst thou,
maid unloving and cold!
much is walhall's rapture,
much is the fame of the gods;
more is my ring.
one glance at its shining gold,
one flash of its sacred fire is more precious than bliss of all the gods enduring for aye!
for siegfried's dear love shines from it bright
and blessèd.
love of siegfried!
ah,
could i but utter the rapture bound up in the ring
go back to the holy council of gods;
repeat what i have told thee of my ring:
that love i will not forswear,
of love they never shall rob me;
sooner shall walhall's glory perish
and pass
the ring upon thy hand-- .
ah, be implored!
for wotan fling it away
waltraute
this is thy faith, then?
to her sorrow thus coldly thou leavest thy sister
brünnhilde
up and away!
swiftly to horse!
i will not part with the ring
waltraute
woe's me!
woe's me!
woe to thee, sister!
woe to walhall's gods
she rushes away.
a storm-cloud immediately rises from the wood,
accompanied by thunder
brünnhilde
as she looks after the brightly lit,
retreating thunder-cloud,
which soon vanishes in the distance
borne by the wind in storm and lightning,
haste away, cloud,
and may i see thee no more
twilight has fallen.
the light of the fire gradually shines more brightly from below.
she gazes quietly out on the landscape
eventide shadows dim the heavens,
and more brightly the flames
that encircle me glow
the firelight approaches from below.
ever-brightening tongues of flame shoot up over the edge of the rock
why leap so wildly the billows
that blaze round the rock?
up here to the peak surges the fiery flood
siegfried's horn is heard from the valley.
brünnhilde starts up in delight
siegfried?
siegfried returned?
with his horn greeting he sends!
up!
out to the welcome!
swift to my god's embrace
she hastens joyfully to the edge of the crag.
flames leap up,
out of which siegfried springs forward on to a high rock,
whereupon the flames immediately withdraw
and again only shine up from below.
brünnhilde recoils in terror,
flies to the foreground, and from there,
in speechless astonishment,
stares at siegfried, who,
wearing the tarnhelm,
which covers the upper half of his face,
leaving only his eyes free,
appears in gunther's form
brünnhilde
betrayed!
who seeks me here
siegfried
remaining on the rock at the back,
motionless and leaning on his shield,
regards brünnhilde.
in a feigned (harsher) voice
brünnhild'!
a wooer comes whom thy fire did not dismay.
i want thee for my wife;
consent to follow me
trembling violently
what man has done this deed undaunted
that the boldest only dares
as before
a hero who will tame thy pride by force at need
brünnhilde
a monster stands upon yonder stone;
an eagle has come to rend me in pieces!
who art thou, frightful one?
art thou a mortal,
or dost thou hie from hella's dark host
siegfried
as before,
beginning with a slightly tremulous voice,
but continuing with more confidence.
a gibichung am i,
and gunther is his name whom thou must follow hence
brünnhilde
breaking out in despair
wotan!
thou cruel, merciless god!
woe!
now i see how thine anger works!
to scorn and sorrow i am condemned
siegfried
springs down from the stone
and approaches
night falls apace;
within thy cave thou must receive thy husband
brünnhilde
stretching out with a threatening gesture the finger on which she wears siegfried's ring
stand back!
fear thou this token!
while i am shielded by this,
thou canst not force me to shame
siegfried
wife it shall make thee to gunther;
with this ring thou shalt be wed
brünnhilde
stand back, base robber!
impious thief!
nor dare, overbold, to draw near!
stronger than steel made by the ring,
i never will yield
siegfried
that it must be mine i learn from thy lips
he presses towards her.
there is a struggle.
brünnhilde wrenches herself free,
flies
and turns round as if to defend herself.
siegfried seizes her again.
she flies;
he reaches her.
they wrestle violently together.
siegfried catches her hand
and draws the ring from her finger.
she gives a loud scream.
as she sinks helpless into his arms her unconscious look meets siegfried's eyes.
siegfried lays her fainting on the stone bench at the entrance to the cave
siegfried
now thou art mine!
brünnhilde, gunther's bride,
lead me the way to thy cave
brünnhilde
stares, as if fainting, before her;
exhausted
o woman undone, where now thy defence
siegfried
drives her on with a gesture of command.
trembling
and with tottering steps she goes into the cave
now, nothung,
witness thou that chastely i have wooed,
and loyal been to my brother;
lie betwixt me and his bride
he follows brünnhilde.
the curtain falls.
in his natural voice
the second act
an open space on the shore in front of the gibichungs' hall;
to the right the open entrance to the hall,
to the left the bank of the rhine.
from the latter,
crossing the stage
and mounting towards the back,
rises a rocky height,
cut by several mountain-paths.
there an altar-stone to fricka is visible,
as well as one, higher up, to wotan,
and one at the side to donner.
it is night.
hagen,
his arm round his spear
and his shield by his side,
fits against one of the pillars of the hall asleep.
the moon shines out suddenly
and throws a vivid light on hagen
and his immediate surroundings.
alberich is seen crouching in front of him,
leaning his arms on hagen's knees
softly
hagen, son, art asleep?
betrayed by drowsiness
and rest thou dost not hear
hagen
softly, without moving,
so
that he seems to sleep on although his eyes are open
i hear thee, o baleful niblung;
what wouldst thou tell me while i slumber
alberich
remember the might thou art endowed with,
if thou art valiant as thy mother bore thee to me
hagen [still as before
though courage she bestowed,
i have no cause to thank her for falling under thy spell;
soon old, wan and pale, hating the happy,
where is my joy
as before
hagen, my son, hate thou the happy;
this joyless and sorrow-laden one,
him alone thou shalt love.
be thou strong and bold and wise!
those whom with weapons of darkness we fight already our hate has dismayed.
and he who captured my ring, wotan,
the ravening robber,
by one of his sons in fight has been vanquished;
he has lost through the wälsung power
and might.
with the whole immortal race he awaits in anguish his downfall.
him i fear no more:
he and all his must perish!
hagen, son, art asleep
hagen
remains motionless as before
the might of the gods who then shall wield
alberich
i--and thou!
the world we shall own,
if in thy truth i rightly trust,
sharest thou my hate and wrath.
wotan's spear was splintered by siegfried,
the hero who won as booty the ring when fafner,
the dragon, he slew.
power supreme he has attained to
the wooing of grimhilde,
the mother of hagen
still mysteriously
walhall and nibelheim bow to his will.
on this hero undaunted my curse falls in vain,
for he knows not the ring's true worth,
nor makes use of its wonderful spell;
laughing he burns life away,
caring only for love.
nothing can serve us but his undoing
sleepest, hagen, my son
as before
already he speeds through me to his doom
alberich
the golden ring
'tis that that we must capture!
the wälsung by a wise woman is loved.
if, urged by her,
to the rhine's fair daughters
who bewitched me once below in the waves
the stolen ring he restored,
forever lost were the gold,
and no guile could win it again.
wherefore with ardour aim for the ring.
i gat thee a stranger to fear,
that against heroes thou mightst uphold me.
i had not the strength, indeed,
to despatch, like the wälsung,
fafner in fight;
but i reared hagen to deadly hatred,
and he shall avenge me
shall win the ring,
putting wälsung and wotan to scorn!
swear to me, hagen, my son
from this point alberich is covered by an ever-deepening shadow.
at the same time day begins to dawn
still as before
the ring shall be mine yet;
quietly wait
alberich
swear to me, hagen, my son
hagen
to myself swear i;
make thy mind easy
alberich
still gradually disappearing,
and his voice, as he does so,
becoming more and more inaudible
be true, hagen, my son!
trusty hero, be true!
be true!
true
alberich has quite disappeared.
hagen, who has never changed position,
looks with fixed eyes
and without moving towards the rhine,
over which the light of dawn is spreading
swear to me, hagen, my son
the gradually brightening red of dawn is reflected in the rhine.
siegfried steps out suddenly from behind a bush close to the shore.
he appears in his own shape,
but has the tarnhelm on his head still;
he takes this off and,
as he comes forward,
hangs it on his girdle
siegfried
hoioh!
hagen!
weary man!
where is thy welcome
rising in a leisurely fashion
hei!
siegfried?
swift-footed hero,
whence stormest thou now
siegfried
from brünnhilde's rock.
'twas there
that i drew the breath i called to thee with;
a quick passage i made!
slower behind me a pair on board a vessel come
hagen
hast thou won brünnhild'
siegfried
wakes gutrune
calling towards the hall
hoiho!
gutrune!
haste and come!
siegfried is here.
why dost delay
siegfried turning to the hall
how brünnhild' yielded ye shall both be told
gutrune comes from the hall to meet him
siegfried
give me fair greeting, gibich's child!
i come to thee with joyful news
gutrune
freia greet thee to the honour of all women
siegfried
to thy lover glad be gracious;
for wife i have won thee to-day
gutrune
comes then brünnhild' with my brother
siegfried
none ever wooed with more ease
gutrune
was he not scorched by the fire
siegfried
it had not burnt him, i trow;
but i broke through it instead,
that i for wife might win thee
gutrune
and no harm didst thou take
siegfried
i laughed 'mid the surge of the flames
gutrune
did brünnhild' think thee gunther
siegfried
like were we to a hair;
the tarnhelm saw to that,
as hagen truly foretold
hagen
i gave thee counsel good
gutrune
and so the bold maid was tamed
siegfried
her pride--gunther broke
gutrune
did she give herself to thee
siegfried
through the night the vanquished brünnhild' to her rightful husband belonged
gutrune
for her husband thou didst pass
siegfried
by gutrune sojourned siegfried
gutrune
but 'twas brünnhild' lay beside thee
pointing to his sword
far as north from east and west,
so far was brünnhild' removed
gutrune
but how got gunther his wife from thee
siegfried
through the flames of the fire as they faded,
when day dawned,
through the mist she followed me down the hill;
when near the shore, none observing,
i gave gunther my place,
and by the tarnhelm's magic wished myself straight to thee.
a strong wind drives the lovers merrily down the rhine;
prepare to greet them with joy
gutrune
siegfried!
such is thy might, i am afraid of thee
calling from the shore
i can see a sail in the distance
siegfried
now be the envoy thanked
gutrune
let us give her gracious greeting,
that glad and gay she here may tarry!
thou, hagen,
prithee summon the men to the hall here for the wedding,
while blithe maids to the feast i bid;
our joy they will merrily share
as she goes towards the hall she turns round again
wilt thou rest, wicked man
siegfried
helping thee is rest enough
he gives her his hand
and accompanies her into the hall
hagen
has mounted a rock at the back,
and starts blowing his cow-horn
hoiho!
hoiho!
hoho!
ye gibich vassals, up and prepare!
woeful tidings!
weapons!
weapons!
arm through the land!
goodly weapons,
mighty weapons sharp for strife!
dire the strait!
woe!
danger!
danger!
hoiho!
hoiho!
hoho
hagen remains where he is on the rock.
armed men arrive in haste by different paths;
first singly,
and then in larger and larger groups
the vassals
why sounds the horn?
who calls us to arms?
we come with our arms?
we come with our weapons.
hagen!
hagen!
hoiho!
hoiho!
who hath suffered scathe?
say, what foe is nigh?
who forces war?
is gunther sore pressed?
we come with our weapons,
with weapons keen!
hoiho!
ho!
hagen
still from the rock
come fully armed without delay!
welcome gunther, your lord:
a wife gunther has wooed
the vassals
is he in straits, pressed by the foe
hagen
a woman hard won with him he brings
the vassals
her kinsmen
and vassals follow for vengeance
hagen
no one follows but his bride
the vassals
then the peril is past,
and the foe put to flight
hagen
the dragon-slayer helped him at need;
siegfried, the hero, kept him from harm
the vassals
how then can his vassals avail him?
and why hast callèd us here
hagen
sturdy oxen ye shall slaughter;
on wotan's altar their blood be shed
the vassals
and after that, hagen?
say, what next
hagen
after that for froh a boar ye shall fell,
and a full-grown
and strong he-goat for donner;
but for fricka sheep ye shall slaughter,
that she may smile on the marriage
the vassals
[with increasing cheerfulness
what shall we do when the beasts we have slain
hagen
the drink-horn take
that women sweet with wine
and mead blithely have filled
the vassals
the drink-horn in hand,
what task awaits us still
hagen
gaily carouse until tamed by wine:
drink, that the gods, duly honoured,
grace may accord to this marriage
the vassals
burst into ringing laughter
good luck and joy laugh on the rhine,
if hagen, the grim one, so merrily jests!
to wedding-feasts hagen invites;
his prick the hedge-thorn, hagen, has lost
hagen
who has remained very grave,
has come down to the men,
and now stands among them
now cease from laughing, doughty vassals!
receive gunther's bride;
yonder come brünnhild' and he
he points towards the rhine.
some of the men hurry to the height;
others range themselves on the shore to watch the arrival.
hagen goes up to some of the men
be to your lady loyal and true;
suffers she wrong, swiftly avenge her
he turns slowly aside
and moves towards the back.
the boat arrives with gunther
and brünnhilde.
those who have been looking out from the height come down to the shore.
some vassals spring into the water
and pull the boat to land.
all press closer to the bank
the vassals
hail!
hail!
hail!
be greeted!
be greeted!
welcome, o gunther!
hail!
hail!
hail
gunther steps out of the boat with brünnhilde
the vassals
range themselves respectfully to receive them
welcome, gunther!
health to thee and to thy bride
they strike their weapons loudly together
gunther
presenting brünnhilde,
who follows him with pale face
and lowered eyes,
to the men
brünnhild', a peerless bride,
here to the rhine i bring.
no man ever won a nobler woman!
the gods have shown from of old grace to the gibichung stock.
to fame unmatched now may it mount
solemnly clash their weapons
hail!
o hail, happy gibichung
gunther
leads brünnhilde,
who never raises her eyes, to the hall,
from which siegfried and gutrune,
attended by women, now come forth.
gunther stops before the hall
dear hero, greetings glad!
i greet thee, fair sister!
by him who won thee for wife i joyfully see thee stand.
two happy pairs here radiant are shining
he draws brünnhilde forward
brünnhild'--and gunther,
gutrun--and siegfried
brünnhilde, startled,
looks up and sees siegfried.
her eyes remain fixed on him in amazement.
gunther,
who has released her violently trembling hand,
shows, as do all present,
blank astonishment at her behaviour
the vassals and women
what ails her?
has she gone mad
siegfried
goes a few steps towards brünnhilde,
who has begun to tremble
why looks brünnhild' amazed
scarcely able to control herself
siegfried .
here?
gutrune
siegfried
gunther's gentle sister,
wed to me as thou to him
with fearful vehemence
i?
gunther?
'tis false
she sways and seems about to fall.
siegfried supports her
light fades from mine eyes.
in siegfried's arms,
looking faintly up at him
siegfried .
knows me not
siegfried
gunther, see, thy wife is swooning
gunther comes to them
wake, brünnhild', wake!
here stands thy husband
brünnhilde
perceives the ring on siegfried's outstretched finger,
and starts up with terrible vehemence
ha!
the ring upon his hand!
siegfried
the vassals
what's wrong
hagen
coming among the vassals from behind
now pay good heed to the woman's tale
brünnhilde
mastering her terrible excitement,
tries to control herself
on thy hand there i beheld a ring.
'twas wrested from me by this man here
pointing to gunther
'tis not thine.
how earnest thou by the ring thou hast on
siegfried
attentively regarding the ring on his finger
'twas not from him i got the ring
to gunther
thou who didst seize the ring with which i wedded thee,
declare to him thy right,
make him yield up the pledge
in great perplexity
the ring?
no ring i gave him,
though thou dost know it well
brünnhilde
where hast thou hid the ring
that thou didst capture from me
gunther, greatly confused, does not answer
breaking out furiously
ha!
he it was who despoiled me of the ring
siegfried,
the treacherous thief
all look expectantly at siegfried,
who seems to be lost in far-off thoughts as he contemplates the ring
siegfried
no woman gave the ring to me,
nor did i wrest it from a woman's grasp.
this ring, i know,
was the booty won when at neidhöhl' boldly i fought,
and the mighty dragon was slain
hagen
stepping between them
brünnhild', dauntless queen,
knowest thou this ring well?
if it was by gunther won, then it is his,
and siegfried has got it by guile.
for his guilt must the traitor pay
shrieking in terrible anguish
betrayed!
betrayed!
shamefully betrayed!
deceived!
deceived!
wrong too deep for revenge
gutrune
a wrong?
to whom
vassals and women
deceit?
to whom
brünnhilde
holy gods!
ye heavenly rulers!
whispered ye this in councils dark?
if i must bear more than ever was borne,
bowed by a shame none ever endured,
teach me such vengeance as never was raved!
kindle such wrath as can never be calmed!
order brünnhild's poor heart to be broken,
bring ye but doom on him who betrayed
gunther
brünnhild', dear wife, control thyself
brünnhilde
away, betrayer!
self-betrayed one!
all of you, hearken!
not he, but that man there,
won me to wife
vassals and women
siegfried?
gutrune's lord
brünnhilde
he forced delight and love from me
siegfried
dost thou so lightly hold thine honour,
the tongue
that thus defames it i must convict of its falsehood.
hear whether faith i broke!
blood-brotherhood i have sworn unto gunther;
nothung, my trusty sword,
guarded the sacred vow;
'twixt me
and this sad woman distraught its blade lay sharp
brünnhilde
behold how thou liest, crafty man,
vainly as witness citing thy sword!
full well i know its keenness,
and also the scabbard wherein so snugly hung on the wall nothung,
the faithful friend,
when its lord won the woman he loved
vassals and women
crowd together in violent indignation
what!
siegfried a traitor?
has he stained gunther's honour
to siegfried
disgraced were i and sullied my name,
were not the slander cast in her teeth
grutune
siegfried faithless?
false to his vow?
ah, prove thou that worthless is her word
the vassals
clear thyself straight;
if thou art wronged silence the slander;
sworn be the oath
siegfried
if i must swear, the slander to still,
which of you offers his sword for the oath
hagen
swear the oath upon the point of my spear;
bad faith 'twill surely avenge
the vassals form a ring round siegfried
and hagen.
hagen holds out the spear;
siegfried lays two fingers of his right hand upon the point
siegfried
shining steel!
weapon most holy,
witness my oath sworn for ever!
on this spear's sharp point i solemnly swear;
spear-point, mark thou my words!
if weapon must pierce me,
thine be the point!
when by death i am stricken strike thou the blow,
if what she tells is true,
and i broke faith with my friend
brünnhilde
strides furiously into the ring,
tears siegfried's hand from the spear,
and grasps the point with her own
shining steel!
weapon most holy,
witness my oath sworn for ever!
on this spear's sharp point i solemnly swear!
spear-point, mark thou my words!
devoted be thy might to his undoing!
be thy sharpness blessed by me,
that it may slay him!
for broken his oaths have been all,
and false is what he has sworn
the vassals
help, donner!
roar with thy thunder to silence this terrible shame
siegfried
gunther,
look to this woman who falsely slanders thy name.
let her rest awhile,
the untamed mountain maid,
that the unbridled rage some demon in malice has against us roused may have the chance to subside.
ye vassals, go ye your ways;
let the womenfolk scold.
like cravens gladly we yield,
comes it to fighting with tongues
he goes up to gunther
thou art not so vexed as i
that i beguiled her ill;
the tarnhelm must, i fear,
but half have hid my face.
still, women's wrath soon is appeased:
that i won her for thee thankful thy wife will be yet
he turns again to the vassals
follow me, men, with mirth to the feast
to the women
gaily, women, help at the wedding!
joyfully laugh love and delight!
in hall
and grove there shall be none this day more merry than i!
ye whom love has blessed,
like myself light-hearted,
follow and share in my mirth
he throws his arm in the highest spirits round gutrune
and draws her into the hall.
the vassals and women follow,
carried away by his example.
all go off, except brünnhilde, gunther,
and hagen.
gunther, in deep shame and dejection,
with his face covered,
has seated himself on one side.
brünnhilde, standing in the foreground,
gazes for some time sorrowfully after siegfried
and gutrune,
then droops her head
lost in thought
what dread demon's might moves here in darkness?
by what wizard's spell worked was the woe?
how weak is my wisdom faced by this puzzle!
and where shall i find the runes for this riddle?
oh, sorrow!
sorrow!
woe's me!
woe's me!
i gave all my wisdom to him
with increasing emotion
the maid in his power he holds.
fast in his fetters bound is the booty
that,
weeping her grievous shame,
gaily to others he gives!
will none of you lend a sword with which i may sever my bonds
hagen
going close to brünnhilde
leave that to me, o wife betrayed;
i will avenge thy trust deceived
looking round dully
on whom
hagen
on siegfried, traitor to thee
brünnhilde
on siegfried?
thou
smiling bitterly
one single flash of his eye
and its lightning
which streamed in its glory on me even through his disguise
and thy heart would fail,
shorn of its courage
hagen
but to my spear his perjury gives him
brünnhilde
truth and falsehood-- what matter words!
to arm thy spear seek for something stronger,
strength such as his to withstand
hagen
well know i siegfried's conquering strength:
how hard in battle to slay him;
but whisper to me some sure device for speeding him to his doom
brünnhilde
ungrateful, shameful return!
i taught him all the arts i know,
to preserve his body from harm
o wife betrayed,
i will avenge thy trust deceived
he bears unwitting a charmèd life
and safely walks by spells enwound
hagen
then no weapon forged could wound him
brünnhilde
in battle none;
yet-- did the blow strike his back!
never--i knew that-- would he give way,
or turn and fly, the foe pursuing,
so there i gave him no blessing
hagen
and there shall my spear strike
he turns quickly from brünnhilde to gunther
up, gunther, noble gibichung!
here stands thy valiant wife.
why hang thy head in grief
gunther
starting up passionately
o shame!
dishonour!
woe is me!
no man has known such sorrow
hagen
in shame thou liest-- that is true
to gunther
o craven man!
falsest of friends!
hidden behind the hero wert thou while won were for thee the prize
and the glory.
low indeed the race must have sunk
that breeds such cowards as thou
beside himself
deceived am i--and deceiver!
betrayed am i--and betrayer!
my strength be consumed,
and broken my heart!
help, hagen!
help for my honour!
help,
for my mother was thine
thee too she bore
hagen
no help from head or hand will suffice:
'tis siegfried's death we need
seized with horror
siegfried's death
hagen
unpurged else were thy shame
staring before him
blood-brotherhood he and i swore
hagen
who broke the bond pays with his blood
gunther
broke he the bond
hagen
in betraying thee
gunther
was i betrayed
brünnhilde
he betrayed thee,
and me ye all are betraying!
if i were just,
all the blood of the world would not atone for your guilt!
but the death of one is all i ask for.
dying,
siegfried atones for himself and you
hagen
turning to gunther
and speaking to him secretly
his death would profit thee;
boundless were indeed thy might if thou couldst capture the ring,
which, alive, he never will yield
softly
brünnhilde's ring
hagen
the ring the niblung wrought
sighing deeply
'twould be the end of siegfried
hagen
his death would serve us all
gunther
but gutrun, to whom he has been given!
how could we look in her face if her husband we had slain
starting up furiously
what wisdom forewarned of,
and runes hinted darkly,
in helpless despair is plain to me now
passionately
gutrune is the spell
that stole my husband's heart away!
woe be her lot
to gunther
if this grief we must give her,
conceal how siegfried died.
we go to-morrow merrily hunting;
the hero gallops ahead;
we find him slain by a boar
brünnhilde and hagen
so shall it be!
perish siegfried!
purged be the shame he brought on me!
faith sworn by oath he has broken;
now with his blood let him atone!
avenging, all-hearing god!
oath-witness, and lord of vows!
wotan, come at my call!
send thou thine awful heavenly host hither to hear while i vow revenge
hagen
doomed let him die, the hero renowned!
mine is the hoard,
and mine i shall hold it!
from him the ring shall be wrested
niblung father!
o fallen prince!
night warder!
nibelung lord!
alberich!
hear thou thy son!
ruling again o'er the nibelung host,
bid them obey thee, the ring's dread lord
as gunther turns impetuously towards the hall with brünnhilde they are met by the bridal procession coming out.
boys and girls,
waving flower-wreathed staves,
leap merrily in front.
the vassals are carrying siegfried on a shield
and gutrune on a seat.
on the rising ground at the back men-servants
and maids are taking implements
and beasts for sacrifice,
by the various mountain-paths,
to the altars,
which they deck with flowers.
siegfried
and the vassals blow wedding-calls on their horns.
the women invite brünnhilde to accompany them to gutrune's side.
brünnhilde stares blankly at gutrune,
who beckons her with a friendly smile.
as brünnhilde is about to step back angrily hagen comes quickly between them
and presses her towards gunther,
who takes her hand again,
whereupon he allows himself to be raised on a shield by the men.
as the procession, scarcely interrupted,
moves on quickly again towards the height,
the curtain falls
the third act
a wild wooded
and rocky valley on the rhine,
which flows past a steep cliff in the background.
the three rhine-maidens, woglinde,
wellgunde, and flosshilde,
rise to the surface and swim
and circle as if dancing
the three rhine-maidens
swimming slower
the sun sends hither rays of glory;
in the depths is darkness.
once there was light,
when clear
and fair our father's gold shone on the billows.
rhinegold!
gleaming gold!
how bright was once thy radiance,
lovely star of the waters
they sing and again start swimming
and circling about.
they pause and listen,
then merrily splash the waters
o sun,
the hero quickly send us who again our gold shall give us!
if it were ours,
we should no longer envy thine eye for its splendour.
rhinegold!
gleaming gold!
how glad was thy radiance,
glorious star of the waters
a horn is heard
woglinde
hark!
that is his horn
wellgunde
the hero comes
flosshilde
let us take counsel
they all dive down quickly
siegfried
appears on the cliff fully armed
some elf has led me astray
and lured my feet from the path.
hey, rogue!
behind what hill hast suddenly hidden my game
the three rhine-maidens
rise to the surface again and swim
and circle as in a dance
siegfried
flosshilde
what art thou scolding about
wellgunde
with what elf art thou so wroth
woglinde
hast thou been tricked by some sprite
all three
tell us, siegfried;
let us hear
siegfried
regarding them with a smile
have ye, then,
hither charmed the shaggy-hided fellow whom i have lost?
frolicsome maids, ye are welcome to him,
if he is your love
the maidens laugh
woglinde
what would our guerdon be, siegfried,
if we restored him
siegfried
i have caught nothing yet,
so ask of me what you will
wellgunde
a golden ring gleams on thy finger
the three rhine-maidens
wilt grant it
siegfried
from a dragon grim i won the ring in fight;
and think ye for a worthless bear-skin i would exchange the gold
woglinde
art thou so mean
wellgunde
in bargains so hard
flosshilde
free-handed thou with women shouldst be
siegfried
on you did i waste my goods,
my wife would have cause to scold
flosshilde
is she a shrew
wellgunde
and beats thee sore
woglinde
has the hero felt her hand
they laugh immoderately
siegfried
though gaily ye may laugh,
in grief ye shall be left, for,
mocking maids,
this ring ye ask shall never be yours
the rhine-maidens have again joined hands for dancing
flosshilde
so fair
wellgunde
so strong
woglinde
so worthy love
the three
how sad he should a miser be
they laugh and dive down
siegfried
comes down nearer to the river
why should i stand their taunts
and blame?
why endure their scorn?
did they return
though gaily ye may laugh,
in grief ye shall be left, for,
mocking maids,
this ring ye ask shall never be yours
to the bank again,
the ring gladly i'd give them
calling loudly
hey, hey!
ye merry water-maidens, come back;
the ring shall be yours
he holds up the ring,
which he has taken from his finger
the three rhine-maidens
rise to the surface again.
they appear grave and solemn
nay, hero, keep and ward it well,
until the harm thou hast felt
that in the ring lies hid.
then wouldst thou fain be freed by us from its curse
siegfried
calmly puts the ring on his finger again
sing something that ye know
the three rhine-maidens
siegfried!
siegfried!
siegfried!
dark our knowledge for thee!
the ring thou keepest to thy own scathe!
from the gleaming gold of the rhine 'twas wrought;
he who cunningly forged it,
and lost it in shame,
laid a curse on it which, for all time,
the owner thereof dooms to his death.
as the dragon fell so shalt thou too fall,
and that to-day;
thy fate is foretold,
wilt thou not give to the rhine the ring to hide in its waters.
its waves alone can loose the curse
siegfried
enough, o ye women full of wiles!
was i firm when ye flattered,
i am firmer now when ye threaten
the three rhine-maidens
siegfried!
siegfried!
our warning is true:
flee, oh, flee from the curse!
the norns who weave by night have entwined it in the rope of fate's decrees
siegfried
my sword once shattered a spear;
and if the norns have woven a curse into the strands of destiny's rope,
nothung will cleave it asunder.
a dragon once warned me of this dread curse,
but he could not teach me to fear
he contemplates the ring
the world's wealth has bestowed on me a ring.
for the grace of love had it been yours,
and still for love might it be got,
but by threats to my life
and my limbs
had it not even a finger's worth
the ring ye never shall gain.
my limbs and my life--
siegfried!
siegfried!
our warning is true:
flee, oh, flee from the curse!
look!
thus freely i fling away
he lifts a clod of earth from the ground,
holds it over his head,
and with the last words throws it behind him
the three rhine-maidens
come, sisters!
fly from the madman!
though dauntless
and wise he seems to himself,
he is blind and in fetters bound fast
wildly excited,
they swim in wide circles close to the shore
oaths he swore, and was false to his word
moving quickly again
runes he knows that he cannot rede.
a glorious gift fell to his lot;
he flung it from him unawares;
and the ring that deals doom
and death alone he will not surrender
farewell, siegfried!
a woman proud ere night falls thy wealth shall inherit.
our cry by her will be heard.
to her!
to her!
to her
they turn quickly to their dance,
and gradually swim away to the back singing
siegfried
looks after them smiling,
one foot on a piece of rock
and his chin resting on his hand
alike on land
and water i have studied women's ways:
still those who mistrust their smiles they seek with threats to frighten,
and, are their threats despised,
at once they begin to scold.
and yet-- held i not gutrun dear,
of these alluring maidens one had surely been mine
he looks calmly after the rhine-maidens,
who have disappeared,
and whose voices gradually die away.
horn-calls are then heard.
siegfried starts from a reverie
and sounds his horn in answer
far off
hoiho
vassals' voices
hoiho!
hoiho!
hoiho
siegfried
having first answered the call with his horn
hoiho!
hoihe
hagen
appears on the height,
followed by gunther.
he sees siegfried
so we have found thee where thou wert hidden
siegfried
come down all!
here 'tis fresh and cool
the vassals now appear on the height,
and come down with hagen and gunther
hagen
here let us rest and see to the meal
they lay the game in a heap
lay down the booty
and hand round the wine-skins
wine-skins
and drinking-horns are produced.
all lie down
hagen
now be the wonders told us of siegfried
and his hunting
that chased the game from us
siegfried
no meal at all is mine;
i beg of you to share with me your spoil
hagen
no luck at all
siegfried
i sought for forest-game,
but water-fowl only i found;
furnished with the right equipment,
a brood of three wild water-birds i had caught
and brought you.
down there on the rhine they told me
that slain to-day i should fall
gunther starts and looks darkly at hagen.
siegfried lies down between gunther
and hagen
hagen
a sorry chase were
that if the luckless hunter fell a victim to the quarry
siegfried
thirst plagues me
hagen
whilst he orders a drinking-horn to be filled for siegfried,
and hands it to him
it has been rumoured, siegfried,
that thou canst tell the meaning of what the birds sing:
does rumour speak true
siegfried
i have not listened for long to their song
he takes the drinking-horn
and turns with it to gunther,
to whom he offers it after he has drunk from it
drink, gunther, drink!
thy brother hands the draught
gunther
looks into the horn with horror.
moodily
a pale draught thou hast poured
more gloomily
thy blood alone is there
laughing
with thine, then, be it mingled
he pours from gunther's horn into his own so
that it runs over
thus mixed the wine flows over to mother earth may it prove a cordial kind
with a deep sigh
thou over-joyous man
low, to hagen
his cheer brünnhild' has marred
low, to siegfried
she speaks less plain to him than speak the birds to thee
siegfried
since i have heard women singing.
the birds i have clean forgot
hagen
but thou didst hear them once
siegfried
turning with animation to gunther
hei!
gunther!
moody-faced man!
come,
i will tell thee tales of my boyhood,
if thou wouldst care to hear them
gunther
'twould please me much
all lie down close to siegfried,
who alone fits upright
hagen
sing, hero, sing
siegfried
mime was a surly old dwarf who because of greed reared me with care,
that when the child grew sturdy
and bold he might slay a dragon grim
that guarded treasure in the wood.
he taught me to forge
and the art of fusing,
but what the craftsman could not achieve the scholar did by skill
and by daring
out of the splinters of a weapon fashioned featly a sword.
my father's blade forged was afresh;
strong and true nothung was tempered,
deemed by the dwarf fit for the fight.
the wood then we sought,
and there the dragon fafner i slew
listen and heed well to my tale;
i have marvels to tell you.
from the dragon's blood my fingers were burning,
and these i raised to my lips;
and barely touched was the blood by my tongue,
when what a bird was saying above me i could hear.
on a bough it sat there and sang:
hei!
siegfried now owns all the nibelung hoard!
oh!
could he the hoard in the cave but find!
tarnhelm, if he could but win it,
would help him to deeds of renown;
and could he discover the ring,
it would make him the lord of the world!
hagen
didst thou take the tarnhelm and ring
a vassal
was that the end of the singing
siegfried
having taken tarnhelm and ring,
once more i listened
and heard the sweet warbler;
he sat above me and sang:
hei!
siegfried now owns both the helm
and the ring!
oh!
let him not listen to mime, the false,
for mime, too, covets the treasure,
and cunningly watches and spies!
he is bent on murdering siegfried;
be siegfried wary of mime!
hagen
'twas well that he warned
the vassals
got mime due payment
siegfried
a deadly-brewed draught he brought me to drink;
but, fear-stricken,
his tongue stammered truly:
nothung stretched him out dead
hagen
with a strident laugh
the steel
that he forged not mime soon tasted
he has another drinking-horn filled,
and drops the juice of a herb into it
the vassals
what further did the bird tell thee
hagen
from my horn drink, hero, first:
a magical draught is this;
it will mind thee of things long forgotten,
and bring old days to remembrance
he offers the horn to siegfried,
who looks into it thoughtfully
and then drinks slowly
siegfried
in sorrow i listened, grieving looked up;
he sat there still and sang.
hei!
siegfried has slain the deceitful dwarf!
i know for him now a glorious bride.
she sleeps where rugged rocks soar;
ringed is her chamber by fire.
who battles the flames wakens the bride,
brünnhilde wins as reward!
hagen
the wood-bird's counsel didst thou follow
siegfried
straight without pause i rose and i ran
gunther listens with increasing astonishment
till i came to the fire-ringed rock.
i passed through the flames,
and for prize i found
more and more ecstatic
sleeping, and clad in bright mail,
a woman lovely and dear.
the hard helmet i loosened with care,
and waked the maid with my kiss.
ah, then the burning,
sweet embrace of brünnhild's rapturous arms
gunther
springing up in the greatest consternation
what says he
two ravens fly up out of a bush,
circle above siegfried,
and then fly away towards the rhine
hagen
didst understand what the ravens there said
siegfried starts up suddenly, and,
turning his back to hagen,
looks after the ravens.
hagen thrusts his spear into siegfried's back
hagen
vengeance--that was the word
gunther
and the vassals rush towards hagen.
siegfried swings his shield on high with both hands in order to throw it on hagen;
his strength fails him;
the shield drops from his grasp backwards,
and he falls down upon it
gunther and vassals
who have tried to hold hagen back in vain
hagen, what dost thou
hagen
death to traitors
he turns calmly away,
and is seen in the gathering twilight disappearing slowly over the height.
gunther bends over siegfried in great grief.
the vassals stand round the dying man full of sympathy
siegfried
supported by two vassals in a fitting posture,
opens radiant eyes
brünnhilde, heaven-born bride, awake!
open thine eyelids!
who again has locked thee in sleep
and bound thee in slumber so fast?
lo!
he that came and kissed thee awake
again breaks the bonds holding thee fettered
and looks on brünnhild's delight.
ah!
those dear eyes now open for ever!
ah!
the soft fragrance borne on her breathing!
death,
thou art welcome-- sweet are thy terrors
brünnhild' greets me,
my bride
he sinks back and dies.
the rest stand round him motionless
and sorrowing.
night has fallen.
at a silent command from gunther the vassals raise siegfried's body
and bear it away slowly in a solemn procession over the height.
the moon breaks through the clouds,
and lights up the funeral procession with increasing clearness as it reaches the top of the hill.
a mist has risen from the rhine which gradually fills the whole stage,
on which the funeral procession has become invisible.
after a musical interlude the mist divides again,
until at length the hall of the gibichungs,
as in act i.
appears with increasing distinctness
it is night.
the moonlight is mirrored in the rhine.
gutrune comes out of her chamber into the hall
was that his horn
she listens
no!
he has not returned.
troubled was my sleep by evil dreams!
then wildly neighed his horse;
brünnhild' laughed, and i woke up afraid.
what woman was it i saw go down to the shore?
i fear this brünnhild'!
is she within
she listens at the door at the right
and calls
brünnhild'!
brünnhild'!
art awake
she opens the door timidly
and looks into the inner room
no one is there!
so it was she i saw go downwards to the rhine
a distant horn sounds
was that his horn?
no!
all silent
she looks out anxiously
would but siegfried return
hagen's voice is heard outside coming nearer.
when gutrune hears it she stands for a time transfixed with terror
hagen
hoiho!
hoiho!
awake!
awake!
lights!
ho!
lights here!
burning torches!
home bring we spoils of the chase.
hoiho!
hoiho
increasing light from the torches is seen without.
hagen enters the hall
up!
gutrun!
give siegfried greeting,
for home to thee thy hero comes
in great fear
what is wrong, hagen?
i heard not his horn
men and women with lights
and firebrands accompany,
in great confusion,
the procession returning with siegfried's body
hagen
the hero pale will blow it no more;
no more will he ride to battle or chase or gaily go wooing fair women
with growing terror
what bring they here
the procession reaches the middle of the hall,
and the vassals set down the body on a hastily improvised platform
hagen
'tis a wild boar's spoil they bring thee:
siegfried, thy husband slain
gutrune shrieks
and falls upon the corpse.
general emotion and mourning
gunther
bends over the fainting gutrune
gutrun, gentle sister!
open thine eyelids!
look up and speak
gutrune
recovering consciousness
siegfried--they have slain siegfried
she pushes gunther back violently
hence!
false-hearted brother,
thou slayer of my husband!
oh, who will help me!
woe's me!
woe's me!
these men have murdered my siegfried
gunther
cast not the blame on me;
'tis hagen who must bear it:
he is the accursèd wild boar
that did the hero to death
hagen
with me art wroth for that
gunther
woe and grief for aye be thy portion
hagen
stepping forward with terrible defiance
yes, then, 'tis true that i slew him.
i, hagen, did him to death!
by my spear he falsely swore,
so by my spear he fell.
i have the sacred right now to demand my booty,
and what i claim is this ring
gunther
away!
thou shalt not have what forfeit falls to me
hagen
ye vassals, judge of my right
gunther
thou wouldst seize gutrune's dower,
insolent niblung son
hagen
draws his sword
'tis thus the niblung son demands his own
he rushes on gunther, who defends himself:
they fight.
the vassals throw themselves between.
gunther falls slain by a stroke from hagen
hagen
mine the ring
he makes a grasp at siegfried's hand,
which raises itself in menace.
all stand transfixed with horror
brünnhilde
advances firmly
and solemnly from the background to the front.
still at the back
silence!
your sorrow clamour less loud!
now for vengeance his wife comes,
the woman all have betrayed
as she comes quietly forward
i have heard you whining as whine children when milk is spilt by their mother;
but lamentation meet for a hero unmatched i have not heard
gutrune
raising herself suddenly from the floor
brünnhilde, spite-envenomed!
thou art the cause of our woe!
for, urged by thee,
the men have slain him;
cursèd hour that brought thee here
brünnhilde
peace, hapless wretch!
thou never wert wife of his;
his leman wert thou, only that.
but i am his lawful bride;
to me was the binding oath sworn,
before thy face he beheld
gutrune
breaking out in sudden despair
accursèd hagen,
why didst thou give the poison
that stole her husband away?
o sorrow!
mine eyes are opened:
brünnhild' was the true love whom through the draught he forgot
she turns from siegfried in shame
and fear,
and, dying, bends over gunther's body;
remaining motionless in this position until the end.
hagen stands defiantly leaning on his spear
and shield,
sunk in gloomy thought,
on the opposite side.
brünnhilde stands alone in the middle.
after long
and absorbed contemplation of siegfried she turns with solemn exaltation to the men
and women
brünnhilde
let great logs be borne to the shore
and high by the rhine be heaped;
fierce
and far let the flames mount
that consume to ashes him who was first among men!
his horse lead to me here,
that with me his lord he may follow.
for my body longs to have part in his glory
and share his honour in death.
obey brünnhild's behest
the young men, during the following,
raise a great pyre of logs before the hall,
near the bank of the rhine;
women decorate this with rugs,
on which they strew plants and flowers
brünnhilde
absorbed anew in contemplation of siegfried's dead face.
her expression brightens
and softens as she proceeds
sheer golden sunshine streams from his face;
none was so pure as he who betrayed.
to wife forsworn, to friend too faithful,
from his own true love-- his only belovèd
barred he lay by his sword.
never did man swear oaths more honest,
no one was ever truer to treaties;
never was love purer than siegfried's;
yet oaths the most sacred,
bonds the most binding,
and true love were never so grossly betrayed
know ye why that was
looking upward
ye gods who guard all vows
that are uttered,
look down on me in my terrible grief,
your guilt never-ending behold!
hear my voice accusing, mighty god!
through his most valiant deed
deed by thee so desired
thou didst condemn him to the doom
that else upon thee had fallen.
he, truest of all, must betray me,
that wise a woman might grow
know i all thou wouldst learn
all things!
all things!
all i know now:
all stands plainly revealed.
round me i hear thy ravens flapping.
by them i send thee back the tidings awaited in fear.
rest in peace now, o god
she signs to the vassals to bear siegfried's body on to the pyre;
at the same time she draws the ring off siegfried's singer,
and regards it musingly
i claim as mine what he has left me.
o gold accurst!
terrible ring!
i now grasp thee and give thee away.
o sisters wise,
ye have my thanks for your counsel good,
ye who dwell in the waters deep of the rhine.
what ye desire i gladly give;
from out my ashes take ye your treasure;
the fire by which i am burnt cleanses the ring of its curse.
down in the waves wash it away,
and guard ever pure the shining gold
that stolen was to your grief
she has put the ring on her finger,
and now turns to the pile of logs on which siegfried's body lies stretched.
taking a great firebrand from one of the men,
she waves it and points to the background
fly home, ye ravens,
tell your lord the tidings
that ye have heard by the rhine.
but fly, as ye go, by brünnhild's rock:
still loge flames there;
bid him follow to walhall;
for the gods are drawing near to their doom
leaps on to the funeral pyre
thus
thrown be the brand on walhall's glittering halls
she hurls the brand on to the pile of wood,
which quickly breaks into flame.
two ravens fly up from the rock by the shore
and vanish in the background.
brünnhilde perceives her horse,
which has just been led in by two men
grane, my horse, be greeted fair
she springs towards him, and,
catching hold of him,
removes his bridle
and bends towards him affectionately
knowest thou, my friend,
to whom we are going?
thy lord lies radiant there in the fire,
siegfried, my hero blest!
thou neighest with joy to think thou shalt join him?
laughing,
the flames allure thee to follow?
feel thou my bosom, feel how it burns;
flames of fire have laid hold on my heart.
ah, to embrace him, by him be embraced,
united for ever in love without end!
heiajoho!
