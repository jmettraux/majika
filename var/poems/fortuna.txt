O Fortune, like the moon
you are changeable,
ever waxing and waning;
hateful life first oppresses
and then soothes
as fancy takes it;
poverty, power,
it melts them like ice.

Fate, savage and empty,
you are a turning wheel,
your position malevolent,
vain health always dissolves,
shadowed and veiled
you plague me too;
now through the game
my naked back
I bring to your villainy.

Fate, in health and in virtue,
is now against me,
affection and defeat
always enslaved.
So at this hour without delay
pluck the vibrating string;
since Fate
strikes down the strong,
everyone weep with me!

I bemoan the wounds of Fortune
with weeping eyes,
for the gifts she made me
she perversely takes away.
It is written in truth,
she has hair in the front
but in the back
she is bald.

On Fortune's throne
I used to sit raised up,
crowned with
the multi-colored flowers of prosperity;
however much I flourished
happy and blessed,
now I fall from the summit
deprived of glory.

The wheel of Fortune turns:
I sink, debased;
another is raised up;
far too high up
a king sits at the summit
o let him fear ruin!
for under the axis is written
