kin of all kings and all folk,
to ethelred the head bow
sinfjotli sawed and sigmund sawed,
atwain with main the stone was done
what fish of all fishes,
swims strong in the flood,
but hath learnt little wit to beware?
thine head must thou buy,
from abiding in hell,
and find me the wan waters flame
andvari folk call me,
call oinn my father,
over many a force have i fared;
for a norn of ill-luck,
this life on me lay through wet ways ever to wade
gold enow, gold enow, a great weregild,
thou hast,
that my head in good hap i may hold;
but thou
and thy son are naught fated to thrive,
the bane shall it be of you both
hnikar i hight, when i gladdened huginn,
and went to battle, bright son of volsung;
now may ye call the carl on the cliff top,
feng or fjolnir:
fain would i with you
tell me this, o hnikar,
since full well thou knowest fate of gods,
good and ill of mankind,
what best our hap foresheweth,
when amid the battle about us sweeps the sword edge
good are many tokens if thereof men wotted when the swords are sweeping:
fair fellow deem i the dark-winged raven,
in war, to weapon-wielder
the second good thing:
when abroad thou goest for the long road well arrayed,
good if thou seest two men standing,
fain of fame within the forecourt
a third thing:
good hearing,
the wolf a howling abroad under ash boughs;
good hap shalt thou have dealing with helm-staves,
if thou seest these fare before thee
no man in fight his face shall turn against the moon's sister low,
late-shining,
for he winneth battle who best beholdeth through the midmost sword-play,
and the sloping ranks best shapeth
great is the trouble of foot ill-tripping,
when arrayed for fight thou farest,
for on both sides about are the d?
sir by thee, guileful,
wishful of thy wounding

well washen let each warrior be,
nor lack meat in the morning,
for who can rule the eve's returning,
and base to fall before fate grovelling

good for thy getting
green go the ways toward the hall of giuki

there the rich king reareth a daughter;

with gold for thy sweetling
a high hall is there reared upon hindfell,
without all around it sweeps the red flame aloft.

dear offspring of kings in the dread norns' despite

why breaks my sleep away,
who has turned from me my wan tormenting
sigmund's son with sigurd's sword e'en now rent down the raven's wall
long have i slept and slumbered long,
many and long are the woes of mankind,

hail to the day come back!
hail, sons of the daylight!
hail to thee, dark night,
and thy daughter!
look with kind eyes a-down,
on us sitting here lonely,
and give unto us the gain
that we long for
hail to the aesir, and the sweet asyniur!
hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!
fair words, wise hearts,
would we win from you,
and healing hands while life we hold
beer bring i to thee,
fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,
mixed is it mightily, mingled with fame,
brimming with bright lays
and pitiful runes,
wise words, sweet words,
speech of great game
runes of war know thou,
if great thou wilt be!
cut them on hilt of hardened sword,
some on the brand's back,
some on its shining side,
twice name tyr therein
sea-runes good at need,
learnt for ship's saving,
for the good health of the swimming horse;
on the stern cut them,
cut them on the rudder-blade
and set flame to shaven oar:
howso big be the sea-hills,
howso blue beneath,
hail from the main then comest thou home
word-runes learn well if thou wilt
that no man pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;
wind thou these, weave thou these,
cast thou these all about thee,
at the thing, where folk throng,
unto the full doom faring
of ale-runes know the wisdom if thou wilt
that another's wife should not bewray thine heart
that trusteth:
cut them on the mead-horn,
on the back of each hand,
and nick an n upon thy nail
ale have thou heed to sign from all harm leek lay thou in the liquor,
then i know for sure never cometh to thee,
mead with hurtful matters mingled
help-runes shalt thou gather if skill thou wouldst gain to loosen child from low-laid mother;
cut be they in hands hollow,
wrapped the joints round about;
call for the good-folks' gainsome helping
learn the bough-runes wisdom if leech-lore thou lovest;
and wilt wot about wounds' searching on the bark be they scored;
on the buds of trees whose boughs look eastward ever
thought-runes shalt thou deal with if thou wilt be of all men fairest-souled wight,
and wisest,
these areded these first cut these first took to heart high hropt
on the shield were they scored
that stands before the shining god,
on early-waking's ear,
on all-knowing's hoof,
on the wheel which runneth under rognir's chariot;
on sleipnir's jaw-teeth,
on the sleigh's traces
on the rough bear's paws,
and on bragi's tongue,
on the wolf's claws, and on eagle's bill,
on bloody wings, and bridge's end;
on loosing palms, and pity's path
on glass, and on gold,
and on goodly silver, in wine
and in wort,
and the seat of the witch-wife;
on gungnir's point, and grani's bosom;
on the norn's nail,
and the neb of the night-owl
all these so cut, were shaven
and sheared,
and mingled in with holy mead,
and sent upon wide ways enow;
some abide with the elves,
some abide with the aesir,
or with the wise vanir,
some still hold the sons of mankind
these be the book-runes,
and the runes of good help,
and all the ale-runes,
and the runes of much might;
to whomso they may avail,
unbewildered unspoilt;
they are wholesome to have:
thrive thou with these then.
when thou hast learnt their lore,
till the gods end thy life-days
now shalt thou choose thee e'en as choice is bidden,
sharp steel's root and stem,
choose song or silence;
see to each in thy heart,
all hurt has been heeded
ne'er shall i flee,
though thou wottest me fey;
never was i born for blenching,
thy loved rede will i hold aright in my heart even as long as i may live
the flame flared at its maddest,
earth's fields fell a-quaking as the red flame aloft licked the lowest of heaven.
few had been fain, of the rulers of folk,
to ride through that flame,
or athwart it to tread
then sigurd smote grani with sword,
and the flame was slaked before the king;
low lay the flames before the fain of fame;
bright gleamed the array
that regin erst owned
the worm sigurd slew,
nor e'er shall
that deed be worsened by age while the world is alive:
but thy brother the king never durst,
never bore the flame to ride down through the fire to fare
out then went sigurd,
the great kings' well-loved,
from the speech and the sorrow,
sore drooping, so grieving,
that the shirt round about him of iron rings woven,
from the sides brake asunder of the brave in the battle
fish of the wild-wood,
worm smooth crawling,
with wolf-meat mingled,
they minced for guttorm;
then in the beaker,
in the wine his mouth knew, they set it,
still doing more deeds of wizards
gudrun of old days drew near to dying as she sat in sorrow over sigurd;
yet she sighed not nor smote hand on hand,
nor wailed she aught as other women
then went earls to her.
full of all wisdom,
fain help to deal to her dreadful heart:
hushed was gudrun of wail, or greeting,
but with a heavy woe was her heart a-breaking
bright
and fair sat the great earls' brides,
gold arrayed before gudrun;
each told the tale of her great trouble,
the bitterest bale she erst abode
then spake giaflaug, giuki's sister:
lo upon earth i live most loveless who of five mates must see the ending,
of daughters twain and three sisters,
of brethren eight,
and abide behind lonely
naught gat gudrun of wail and greeting,
so heavy was she for her dead husband,
so dreadful-hearted for the king laid dead there
then spake herborg queen of hunland
crueller tale have i to tell of,
of my seven sons down in the southlands,
and the eighth man, my mate,
felled in the death-mead
father and mother, and four brothers,
on the wide sea the winds
and death played with;
the billows beat on the bulwark boards
alone must i sing o'er them,
alone must i array them,
alone must my hands deal with their departing;
and all this was in one season's wearing,
and none was left for love or solace
then was i bound a prey of the battle,
when that same season wore to its ending;
as a tiring may must i bind the shoon of the duke's high dame,
every day at dawning
from her jealous hate gat i heavy mocking,
cruel lashes she laid upon me,
never met i better master or mistress worser in all the wide world
naught gat gudrun of wail or greeting,
so heavy was she for her dead husband,
so dreadful-hearted for the king laid dead there
then spake gullrond,
giuki's daughter-- o foster-mother,
wise as thou mayst be,
naught canst thou better the young wife's bale.
and she bade uncover the dead king's corpse
she swept the sheet away from sigurd,
and turned his cheek towards his wife's knees
look on thy loved one lay lips to his lips,
e'en as thou wert clinging to thy king alive yet
once looked gudrun-- one look only,
and saw her lord's locks lying all bloody,
the great man's eyes glazed and deadly,
and his heart's bulwark broken by sword-edge
back then sank gudrun,
back on the bolster,
loosed was her head array,
red did her cheeks grow,
and the rain-drops ran down over her knees
then wept gudrun, giuki's daughter,
so
that the tears flowed through the pillow;
as the geese withal
that were in the homefield,
the fair fowls the may owned,
fell a-screaming
then spake gullrond,
giuki's daughter
surely knew i no love like your love among all men,
on the mould abiding;
naught wouldst thou joy in without or within doors,
o my sister, save beside sigurd
then spake gudrun,
giuki's daughter
such was my sigurd among the sons of giuki,
as is the king leek o'er the low grass waxing,
or a bright stone strung on band,
or a pearl of price on a prince's brow
once was i counted by the king's warriors higher than any of herjan's mays;
now am i as little as the leaf may be,
amid wind-swept wood now when dead he lieth
i miss from my seat, i miss from my bed,
my darling of sweet speech.
wrought the sons of giuki,
wrought the sons of giuki,
this sore sorrow, yea, for their sister,
most sore sorrow
so may your lands lie waste on all sides,
as ye have broken your bounden oaths!
ne'er shalt thou, gunnar,
the gold have joy of;
the dear-bought rings shall drag thee to death,
whereon thou swarest oath unto sigurd
ah,
in the days by-gone great mirth in the homefield when my sigurd set saddle on grani,
and they went their ways for the wooing of brynhild!
an ill day, an ill woman,
and most ill hap
then spake brynhild,
budli's daughter
may the woman lack both love
and children,
who gained greeting for thee, o gudrun!
who gave thee this morning many words
then spake gullrond,
giuki's daughter
hold peace of such words thou hated of all folk!
the bane of brave men hast thou been ever,
all waves of ill wash over thy mind,
to seven great kings hast thou been a sore sorrow,
and the death of good will to wives
and women
then spake brynhild,
budli's daughter
none but atli brought bale upon us,
my very brother born of budli
when we saw in the hall of the hunnish people the gold a-gleaming on the kingly giukings;
i have paid for that faring oft and full,
and for the sight that then i saw
by a pillar she stood
and strained its wood to her;
from the eyes of brynhild,
budli's daughter, flashed out fire,
and she snorted forth venom,
as the sore wounds she gazed on of the dead-slain sigurd
byrnies short cut, strong helms hammered,
girt with good swords, red hair gleaming
on the horn's face were there all the kin of letters cut aright
and reddened,
how should i rede them rightly?
the ling-fish long of the land of hadding,
wheat-ears unshorn,
and wild things' inwards
in
that beer were mingled many ills together,
blood of all the wood
and brown-burnt acorns,
the black dew of the hearth,
the god-doomed dead beast's inwards,
and the swine's liver sodden because all wrongs
that deadens
off were the head if erp were alive yet,
our brother the bold,
whom we slew by the way,
the well-famed in warfare
now may all earls be bettered in mind,
may the grief of all maidens ever be minished,
for this tale of trouble so told to its ending
loth am i, sister of sorrow to tell thee,
for by hard need driven have i drawn on the greeting;
this morning fell in fetter-grove the king well deemed the best in the wide world,
yea,
he who stood on the necks of the strong
sigrun:
all oaths once sworn shall bite thee sore,
the oaths
that to helgi once thou swarest at the bright white water of lightening,
and at the cold rock
that the sea runneth over
may the ship sweep not on
that should sweep at its swiftest,
though the wind desired behind thee driveth!
may the horse never run
that should run at his most might when from thy foe's face thou hast most need to flee
may the sword never bite
that thou drawest from scabbard but
and if round thine head in wrath it singeth
then should meet price be paid for helgi's slaying when a wolf thou wert out in the wild-wood,
empty of good things empty of gladness,
with no meat for thy mouth but dead men's corpses
dag:
with mad words thou ravest,
thy wits are gone from thee,
when thou for thy brother such ill fate biddest;
odin alone let all this bale loose,
casting the strife-runes gtwixt friends
and kindred
rings of red gold will thy brother give thee,
and the stead of vandil
and the lands of vigdale;
have half of the land for thy sorrow's healing,
o ring-arrayed sweetling for thee
and thy sons
sigrun:
no more sit i happy at sevafell;
at day-dawn,
at night naught love i my life till broad o'er the people my lord's light breaketh;
till his war-horse runneth beneath him hither,
well wont to the gold bit
till my king i welcome
in such wise did helgi deal fear around to all his foes
and all their friends as when the goat runneth before the wolf's rage filled with mad fear down from the fell
as high above all lords did helgi beat him as the ash-tree's glory from the thorn ariseth,
or as the fawn with the dew-fell sprinkled is far above all other wild things,
as his horns go gleaming ggainst the very heavens
helgi:
now shalt thou,
hunding for the help of each man get ready the foot-bath,
and kindle the fire;
the hounds shalt thou bind
and give heed to the horses,
give wash to the swine ere to sleep thou goest
bondmaid:
it is vain things' beguilling
that methinks i behold,
or the ending of all things, as ye ride,
o ye dead men,
smiting with spurs your horses' sides?
or may dead warriors wend their ways homeward
the dead:
no vain things' beguiling is
that thou beholdest,
nor the ruin of all things;
though thou lookest upon us,
though we smite with spurs our horses' sides;
rather dead warriors may wend their ways homeward
bondmaid:
go out, sigrun from sevafell,
if thou listest to look on the lord of thy people!
for the mound is uncovered thither is helgi come,
and his wounds are bleeding,
but the king thee biddeth to come
and stay that stream of sorrow
sigrun:
now am i as fain of this fair meeting,
as are the hungry hawks of odin,
when they wot of the slaying of the yet warm quarry,
or bright with dew see the day a-dawning
ah, i will kiss my king laid lifeless,
ere thou castest by thy blood-stained byrny.
o helgi,
thy hair is thick with death's rime,
with the dew of the dead is my love all dripping;
dead-cold are the hands of the son of hogni;
how for thee, o my king, may i win healing
helgi:
thou alone, sigrun of sevafell,
hast so done
that helgi with grief's dew drippeth;
o clad in gold cruel tears thou weepest,
bright may of the southlands,
or ever thou sleepest;
each tear in blood falleth on the breast of thy lord,
cold wet
and bitter-sharp swollen with sorrow
ah,
we shall drink dear draughts and lovely,
though, we have lost both life and lands;
neither shall any sing song of sorrow,
though in my breast be wounds wide to behold:
for now are brides in the mound abiding;
kings' daughters sit by us departed
sigrun:
here, helgi, for thee a bed have i dight,
kind without woe, o kin of the ylfings!
to thy bosom, o king,
will i come and sleep soft,
as i was wont when my lord was living
helgi:
now will i call naught not to be hoped for early or late at sevafell,
when thou in the arms of a dead man art laid,
white maiden of hogni, here in the mound:
and thou yet quick, o king's daughter
now needs must i ride on the reddening ways;
my pale horse must tread the highway aloft;
west must i go to windhelm's bridge ere the war-winning crowd hall-crower waketh
sigrun:
here now would he come,
if to come he were minded;
sigmund's offspring from the halls of odin.
o me the hope waneth of helgi's coming;
for high on the ash-boughs are the ernes abiding,
and all folk drift toward the thing of the dreamland
bondmaid:
be not foolish of heart,
and fare all alone to the house of the dead,
o hero's daughter!
for more strong
and dreadful in the night season are all dead warriors than in the daylight
now this is my first counsel,
that thou with thy kin be guiltless,
guileless ever, nor hasty of wrath,
despite of wrong done
unto the dead good that doeth
lo the second counsel,
that oath thou swearest never,
but trusty oath and true:
grim tormenting gripes troth-breakers;
cursed wretch is the wolf of vows
this is my third rede,
that thou at the thing deal not with the fools of folk;
for unwise man from mouth lets fall worser word than well he wotteth
yet hard it is
that holding of peace when men shall deem thee dastard,
or deem the lie said soothly;
but woeful is home-witness,
unless right good thou gettest it.
ah,
on another day drive the life from out him,
and pay the liar back for his lying
now behold the fourth rede:
if ill witch thee bideth,
woe-begatting by the way,
good going further rather than guesting,
though thick night be on thee
far-seeing eyes need all sons of men who wend in wrath to war;
for baleful women bide oft by the highway,
swords and hearts to soften
and now the fifth rede:
as fair as thou seest brides on the bench abiding,
let not love's silver rule over thy sleeping;
draw no woman to kind kissing
for the sixth thing,
i rede when men sit a-drinking amid ale-words
and ill-words,
dead thou naught with the drunken fight-staves for wine stealeth wit from many
brawling
and drink have brought unto men sorrow sore oft enow;
yea, bane unto some,
and to some weary bale;
many are the griefs of mankind
for the seventh, i rede thee,
if strife thou raisest with a man right high of heart,
better fight a-field than burn in the fire within thine hall fair to behold
the eighth rede that i give thee:
unto all ill look thou,
and hold thine heart from all beguiling;
draw to thee no maiden,
no man's wife bewray thou,
urge them not unto unmeet pleasure
this is the ninth counsel:
that thou have heed of dead folk whereso thou findest them a-field;
be they sick-dead, be they sea-dead,
or come to ending by war-weapons
let bath be made for such men fordone,
wash thou hands and feet thereof,
comb their hair
and dry them ere the coffin has them;
then bid them sleep full sweetly
this for the tenth counsel:
that thou give trust never unto oaths of foeman's kin,
be'st thou bane of his brother,
or hast thou felled his father;
wolf in young son waxes,
though he with gold be gladdened
for wrong
and hatred shall rest them never,
nay, nor sore sorrow.
both wit
and weapons well must the king have who is fain to be the foremost
the last rede and eleventh:
until all ill look thou.
and watch thy friends' ways ever scarce durst i look for long life for thee,
king:
strong trouble ariseth now already
sigurd of yore,
sought the dwelling of giuki, as he fared,
the young volsung, after fight won;
troth he took from the two brethren;
oath swore they betwixt them,
those bold ones of deed
a may they gave to him
and wealth manifold,
gudrun the young, giuki's daughter:
they drank
and gave doom many days together,
sigurd the young, and the sons of giuki
until they wended for brynhild's wooing,
sigurd a-riding amidst their rout;
the wise young volsung who knew of all ways
ah!
he had wed her, had fate so willed it
southlander sigurd a naked sword, bright,
well grinded, laid betwixt them;
no kiss he won from the fair woman,
nor in arms of his did the hun king hold her,
since he gat the young maid for the son of giuki
no lack in her life she wotted of now,
and at her death-day no dreadful thing for a shame indeed or a shame in seeming;
but about and betwixt went baleful fate
alone, abroad, she sat of an evening,
of full many things she fall a-talking:
o for my sigurd!
i shall have death, or my fair,
my lovely, laid in mine arms
for the word once spoken,
i sorrow sorely-- his queen is gudrun,
i am wed to gunnar;
the dread norns wrought for us a long while of woe
oft with heart deep in dreadful thoughts,
o'er ice-fields
and ice-hills she fared a-night time,
when he
and gudrun were gone to their fair bed,
and sigurd wrapped the bed-gear round her
ah!
now the hun king his queen in arms holdeth,
while love i go lacking,
and all things longed for with no delight but in dreadful thought
these dreadful things thrust her toward murder:
"listen, gunnar,
for thou shalt lose my wide lands, yea,
me myself!
never love i my life,
with thee for my lord--
i will fare back thither from whence i came,
to my nighest kin
and those
that know me there shall i sit sleeping my life away,
unless thou slayest sigurd the hun king,
making thy might more e'en than his might was
yea, let the son fare after the father,
and no young wolf a long while nourish!
for on earth man lieth vengeance lighter,
and peace shall be surer if the son live not
adrad was gunnar, heavy-hearted was he,
and in doubtful mood day-long he sat.
for naught he wotted,
nor might see clearly what was the seemliest of deeds to set hand to;
what of all deeds was best to be done:
for he minded the vows sworn to the volsung,
and the sore wrong to be wrought against sigurd
wavered his mind a weary while,
no wont it was of those days worn by,
that queens should flee from the realms of their kings
brynhild to me is better than all,
the child of budli is the best of women.
yea, and my life will i lay down,
ere i am twinned from
that woman's treasure
he bade call hogni to the place where he bided;
with all the trust that might be,
trowed he in him
wilt thou bewray sigurd for his wealth's sake?
good it is to rule o'er the rhine's metal;
and well content great wealth to wield,
biding in peace and blissful days
one thing alone hogni had for an answer:
such doings for us are naught seemly to do;
to rend with sword oaths once sworn,
oaths once sworn, and troth once plighted
nor know we on mould, men of happier days,
the while we four rule over the folk;
while the bold in battle, the hun king,
bides living
and no nobler kin shall be known afield,
if our five sons we long may foster;
yea, a goodly stem shall surely wax.
but i clearly see in what wise it standeth,
brynhild's sore urging o'ermuch on thee beareth
guttorm shall we get for the slaying,
our younger brother bare of wisdom;
for he was out of all the oaths sworn,
all the oaths sworn,
and the plighted troth
easy to rouse him who of naught recketh!
deep stood the sword in the heart of sigurd
there, in the hall,
gat the high-hearted vengeance;
for he can his sword at the reckless slayer:
out at guttorm flew gram the mighty,
the gleaming steel from sigurd's hand
down fell the slayer smitten asunder;
the heavy head
and the hands fell one way,
but the feet
and such like aback where they stood
gudrun was sleeping soft in the bed,
empty of sorrow by the side of sigurd:
when she awoke with all pleasure gone,
swimming in blood of frey's beloved
so sore her hands she smote together,
that the great-hearted gat raised in bed;
"o gudrun, weep not so woefully,
sweet lovely bride,
for thy brethren live for thee
a young child have i for heritor;
too young to win forth from the house of his foes.
black deeds
and ill have they been a-doing,
evil rede have they wrought at last
late, late,
rideth with them unto the thing,
such sister's son, though seven thou bear,
--but well i wot which way all goeth;
alone wrought brynhild this bale against us
that maiden loved me far before all men,
yet wrong to gunnar i never wrought;
brotherhood i heeded
and all bounden oaths,
that none should deem me his queen's darling
weary sighed gudrun,
as the king gat ending,
and so sore her hands she smote together,
that the cups arow rang out therewith,
and the geese cried on high
that were in the homefield
then laughed brynhild budli's daughter,
once, once only, from out her heart;
when to her bed was borne the sound of the sore greeting of giuki's daughter
then, quoth gunnar, the king,
the hawk-bearer, whereas, thou laughest,
o hateful woman, glad on thy bed,
no good it betokeneth:
why lackest thou else thy lovely hue?
feeder of foul deeds, fey do i deem thee
well worthy art thou before all women,
that thine eyes should see atli slain of us;
that thy brother's wounds thou shouldest see a-bleeding,
that his bloody hurts thine hands should bind
no man blameth thee, gunnar,
thou hast fulfilled death's measure but naught atli feareth all thine ill will;
life shall he lay down later than ye,
and still bear more might aloft than thy might
i shall tell thee, gunnar,
though well the tale thou knowest,
in what early days ye dealt abroad your wrong:
young was i then, worn with no woe,
good wealth i had in the house of my brother
no mind had i that a man should have me,
or ever ye giukings, rode into our garth;
there ye sat on your steeds three kings of the people
--ah!
that that faring had never befallen
then spake atli to me apart,
and said
that no wealth he would give unto me,
neither gold nor lands if i would not be wedded;
nay,
and no part of the wealth apportioned,
which in my first days he gave me duly;
which in my first days he counted down
wavered the mind within me then,
if to fight i should fall
and the felling of folk,
bold in byrny because of my brother;
a deed of fame had that been to all folk,
but to many a man sorrow of mind
so i let all sink into peace at the last:
more grew i minded for the mighty treasure,
the red-shining rings of sigmund's son;
for no man's wealth else would i take unto me
for myself had i given to
that great king who sat amid gold on the back of grani;
nought were his eyes like to your eyen,
nor in any wise went his visage with yours;
though ye might deem you due kings of men
one i loved, one, and none other,
the gold-decked may had no doubtful mind;
thereof shall atli wot full surely,
when he getteth to know i am gone to the dead
far be it from me, feeble and wavering,
ever to love another's love--
yes shall my woe be well avenged
up rose gunnar, the great men's leader,
and cast his arms about the queen's neck;
and all went nigh one after other,
with their whole hearts her heart to turn
but then all these from her neck she thrust,
of her long journey no man should let her
then called he hogni to have talk with him;
let all folk go forth into the hall,
thine with mine-- --o need sore
and mighty!
to wot if we yet my wife's parting may stay.
till with time's wearing some hindrance wax
one answer hogni had for all;
nay, let hard need have rule thereover,
and no man let her of her long journey!
never born again,
may she come back thence
luckless she came to the lap of her mother,
born into the world for utter woe,
to many a man for heart-whole mourning
upraised he turned from the talk
and the trouble,
to where the gem-field dealt out goodly treasure;
as she looked
and beheld all the wealth that she had,
and the hungry bondmaids,
and maids of the hall
with no good in her heart she donned her gold byrny,
ere she thrust the sword point through the midst of her body:
on the boister's far side sank she adown,
and, smitten with sword,
still bethought her of redes
let all come forth who are fain the red gold,
or things less worthy to win from my hands;
to each one i give a necklace gilt over,
wrought hangings and bed=gear,
and bright woven weed
all they kept silence,
and thought what to speak,
then all at once answer gave:
full enow are death-doomed,
fain are we to live yet,
maids of the hall all meet work winning
from her wise heart at last the linen-clad damsel,
the one of few years gave forth the word:
i will
that none driven by hand or by word,
for our sake should lose well-loved life
thou on the bones of you surely shall burn,
less dear treasure at your departing nor with menia's meal shall ye come to see me
sit thee down, gunnar,
a word must i say to thee of the life's ruin of thy lightsome bride
--nor shall thy ship swim soft
and sweetly for all that i lay life adown
sooner than ye might deem shall ye make peace with gudrun,
for the wise woman shall full in the young wife the hard memory of her dead husband
there is a may born reared by her mother,
whiter
and brighter than is the bright day;
she shall be swanhild,
she shall be sunbeam
thou shalt give gudrun unto a great one,
noble, well-praised of the world's folk;
not with her goodwill,
or love shalt thou give her;
yet will atli come to win her,
my very brother, born of budli
"ah!
many a memory of how ye dealt with me,
how sorely,
how evilly ye ever beguiled me,
how all pleasure left me the while my life lasted
fain wilt thou be oddrun to win,
but thy good liking shall atli let;
but in secret wise shall ye win together,
and she shall love thee as i had loved thee,
if in such wise fare had willed it
but with all ill shall atli sting thee,
into the strait worm-close shall he cast thee
but no long space shall slip away ere atli too all life shall lose,
yea,
all his weal with the life of his sons,
for a dreadful bed dights gudrun for him,
from a heart sore laden,
with the sword's sharp edge
more seemly for gudrun, your very sister,
in death to wend after her love first wed;
had but good rede to her been given,
or if her heart had been like to my heart
"faint my speech groweth
but for our sake ne'er shall she lose her life beloved;
the sea shall have her,
high billows bear her forth unto jonakr's fair land of his fathers
there shall she bear sons,
stays of a heritage, stays of a heritage,
jonakr's sons;
and swanhild shall she send from the land,
that may born of her,
the may born of sigurd
her shall bite the rede of bikki,
whereas for no good wins jormunrek life;
and so is clean perished all the kin of sigurd,
yea, and more greeting,
and more for gudrun
and now one prayer yet pray i of thee
that last word of mine here in the world
so broad on the field be the burg of the dead
that fair space may be left for us all to lie down,
all those that died at sigurd's death
hang round that burg fair hangings
and shields,
web by gauls woven,
and folk of the gauls:
there burn the hun king lying beside me
but on the other side burn by the hun king those who served me strewn with treasure;
two at the head, and two at the feet,
two hounds therewith,
and two hawks moreover:
then is all dealt with even dealing
lay there amidst us the right-dight metal,
the sharp-edged steel, that so lay erst;
when we both together into one bed went,
and were called by the name of man
and wife
never, then,
belike shall clash behind him valhall's bright door with rings bedight:
and if my fellowship followeth after,
in no wretched wise then shall we wend
for him shall follow my five bondmaids,
my eight bondsmen, no borel folk:
yea, and my fosterer,
and my father's dower
that budli of old days gave to his dear child
much have i spoken, more would i speak,
if the sword would give me space for speech;
but my words are waning,
my wounds are swelling
naught but truth have i told--
and now make i ending
the giant-woman nay,
with my goodwill never goest thou through this stone-pillared stead of mine!
more seemly for thee to sit sewing the cloth,
than to go look on the love of another
what dost thou,
going from the land of the gauls,
o restless head, to this mine house?
golden girl, hast thou not,
if thou listest to hearken,
in sweet wise from thy hands the blood of men washen
brynhild nay, blame me naught,
bride of the rock-hall,
though i roved a warring in the days
that were;
the higher of us twain shall i ever be holden when of our kind men make account
the giant-woman thou, o brynhild,
budli's daughter,
wert the worst ever born into the world;
for giuki's children death hast thou gotten,
and turned to destruction their goodly dwelling
brynhild i shall tell thee true tale from my chariot,
o thou who naught wottest,
if thou listest to wot;
how for me they have gotten those heirs of giuki,
a loveless life, a life of lies
hild under helm, the hlymdale people,
e'en those who knew me, ever would call me
the changeful shapes of us eight sisters,
the wise king bade under oak-tree to bear;
of twelve winters was i,
if thou listest to wot,
when i sware to the young lord oaths of love
thereafter gat i mid the folk of the goths,
for helmgunnar the old,
swift journey to hell,
and gave to aud's brother the young,
gain and glory;
whereof overwrath waxed odin with me
so he shut me in shield-wall in skata grove,
red shields
and white close set around me;
and bade him alone my slumber to break who in no land knew how to fear
he set round my hall,
toward the south quarter,
the bane of all trees burning aloft;
and ruled
that he only thereover should ride who should bring me the gold o'er which fafnir brooded
then upon grani rode the goodly gold-strewer to where my fosterer ruled his fair dwelling.
he who alone there was deemed best of all,
the war-lord of the danes,
well worthy of men
in peace did we sleep soft in one bed,
as though he had been naught but my brother:
there as we lay through eight nights wearing,
no hand in love on each other we laid
yet thence blamed me, gudrun,
giuki's daughter,
that i had slept in the arms of sigurd;
and then i wotted as i fain had not wotted,
that they had bewrayed me in my betrothals
ah!
for unrest all too long are men
and women made alive!
yet we twain together shall wear through the ages,
sigurd and i.
--sink adown, o giant-wife
what hath wrought sigurd of any wrong-doing
that the life of the famed one thou art fain of taking
to me has sigurd sworn many oaths,
sworn many oaths, and sworn them lying,
and he bewrayed me when it behoved him of all folk to his troth to be the most trusty
thee hath brynhild unto all bale,
and all hate whetted,
and a work of sorrow;
for she grudges to gudrun all goodly life;
and to thee the bliss of her very body
some the wolf roasted,
some minced the worm,
some unto guttorm gave the wolf-meat,
or ever they might in their lust for murder on the high king lay deadly hand
sigurd lay slain on the south of the rhine high from the fair tree croaked forth the raven,
ah, yet shall atli on you redden edges,
the old oaths shall weigh on your souls,
o warriors
without stood gudrun, giuki's daughter,
and the first word she said was even this word:
where then is sigurd, lord of the warfolk,
since my kin come riding the foremost
one word hogni had for an answer:
our swords have smitten sigurd asunder,
and the grey horse hangs drooping o'er his lord lying dead
then quoth brynhild, budli's daughter;
good weal shall ye have of weapons
and lands,
that sigurd alone would surely have ruled if he had lived but a little longer
ah,
nothing seemly for sigurd to rule giuki's house
and the folk of the goths,
when of him five sons for the slaying of men,
eager for battle,
should have been begotten
then laughed brynhild
loud rang the whole house
one laugh only from out her heart:
long shall your bliss be of lands
and people,
whereas the famed lord you have felled to the earth
then spake gudrun, giuki's daughter;
much thou speakest, many things fearful,
all grame be on gunnar the bane of sigurd!
from a heart full of hate shall come heavy vengeance
forth sped the even enow there was drunken,
full enow was there of all soft speech;
and all men got sleep when to bed they were gotten;
gunnar only lay waking long after all men
his feet fell he to moving,
fell to speak to himself the waster of men,
still turned in his mind what on the bough those twain would be saying,
the raven and erne,
as they rode their ways homeward
but brynhild awoke, budli's daughter,
may of the shield-folk,
a little ere morning:
thrust ye on, hold ye back,
now all harm is wrought,
to tell of my sorrow,
or to let all slip by me
all kept silence after her speaking,
none might know that woman's mind,
or why she must weep to tell of the work
that laughing once of men she prayed
brynhild spake:
in dreams, o gunnar,
grim things fell on me;
dead-cold the hall was,
and my bed was a-cold, and thou, lord,
wert riding reft of all bliss,
laden with fetters gmid the host of thy foemen
so now all ye, o house of the niblungs,
shall be brought to naught,
o ye oath-breakers
think'st thou not, gunnar, how
that betid,
when ye let the blood run both in one footstep?
with ill reward hast thou rewarded his heart so fain to be the foremost
as well was seen when he rode his ways,
that king of all worth, unto my wooing;
how the host-destroyer held to the vows sworn beforetime,
sworn to the young king
for his wounding-wand all wrought with gold,
the king beloved laid between us;
without were its edges wrought with fire,
but with venom-drops deep dyed within
a may of all mays my mother reared me bright in bower;
well loved i my brethren,
until that giuki with gold arrayed me,
with gold arrayed me,
and gave me to sigurd
such was my sigurd,
among the sons of giuki as is the green leek o'er the low grass waxen,
or a hart high-limbed over hurrying deer,
or glede-red gold over grey silver
till me they begrudged, those my brethren,
the fate to have him,
who was first of all men;
nor might they sleep, nor sit a-dooming,
ere they let slay my well-loved sigurd
grani ran to the thing,
there was clatter to hear,
but never came sigurd himself thereunto;
all the saddle-girt beasts with blood were besprinkled,
as faint with the way neath the slayers they went
then greeting i went with grani to talk,
and with tear-furrowed cheeks i bade him tell all;
but drooping laid grani,
his head in the grass,
for the steed well wotted of his master's slaying
a long while i wandered,
long my mind wavered,
ere the kings i might ask concerning my king
then gunnar hung head,
but hogni told of the cruel slaying of my sigurd:
on the water's far side lies,
smitten to death,
the bane of guttorm to the wolves given over
go, look on sigurd,
on the ways that go southward,
there shalt thou hear the ernes high screaming,
the ravens a-croaking as their meat they crave for;
thou shalt hear the wolves howling over thine husband
how hast thou, hogni,
the heart to tell me,
me of joy made empty, of such misery?
thy wretched heart may the ravens tear wide over the world,
with no men mayst thou wend
one thing hogni had for answer,
fallen from his high heart,
full of all trouble:
more greeting yet, o gudrun, for thee,
if my heart the ravens should rend asunder
thence i turned from the talk
and the trouble to go a leasing what the wolves had left me;
no sigh i made no smote hands together,
nor did i wail as other women when i sat over my sigurd slain
night methought it,
and the moonless dark,
when i sat in sorrow over sigurd;
better than all things i deemed it would be if they would let me cast my life by,
or burn me up as they burn the birch-wood
from the fell i wandered five days together,
until the high hall of half lay before me;
seven seasons there i sat with thora,
the daughter of hacon, up in denmark
my heart to gladden with gold she wrought southland halls
and swans of the dane-folk;
there had we painted the chiefs a-playing;
fair our hands wrought folk of the kings
red shields we did,
doughty knights of the huns,
hosts spear-dight, hosts helm-dight,
all a high king's fellows;
and the ships of sigmund from the land swift sailing;
heads gilt over and prows fair graven
on the cloth we broidered
that tide of their battling,
siggeir and siggar, south in fion
then heard grimhild,
the queen of gothland, how i was abiding,
weighed down with woe;
and she thrust the cloth from her
and called to her sons,
and oft and eagerly asked them thereof,
who for her son would their sister atone,
who for her lord slain would lay down weregild
fain was gunnar gold to lay down all wrongs to atone for,
and hogni in likewise;
then she asked who was fain of faring straightly,
the steed to saddle to set forth the wain,
the horse to back, and the hawk to fly,
to shoot forth the arrow from out the yew-bow
valdarr the dane-king came with jarisleif eymod the third went then went jarizskar;
in kingly wise in they wended,
the host of the longbeards;
red cloaks had they, byrnies short-cut,
helms strong hammered, girt with glaives,
and hair red-gleaming
each would give me gifts desired,
gifts desired, speech dear to my heart,
if they might yet, despite my sorrow,
win back my trust,
but in them nought i trusted
then brought me grimhild a beaker to drink of,
cold
and bitter, wrong's memory to quench;
made great was
that drink with the might of the earth,
with the death-cold sea
and the blood that son holdeth
on
that horn's face were there all the kin of letters cut aright
and reddened,
how should i rede them rightly
the ling-fish long of the land of hadding,
wheat-ears unshorn,
and wild things' inwards
in
that mead were mingled many ills together,
blood of all the wood,
and brown-burnt acorns;
the black dew of the hearth,
and god-doomed dead beasts' inwards
and the swine's liver sodden,
for wrongs late done that deadens
then waned my memory when
that was within me,
of my lord 'mid the hall by the iron laid low.
three kings came before my knees ere she herself fell to speech with me
i will give to thee, gudrun,
gold to be glad with,
all the great wealth of thy father gone from us,
rings of red gold
and the great hall of lodver,
and all fair hangings left by the king late fallen
maids of the huns woven pictures to make,
and work fair in gold till thou deem'st thyself glad.
alone shalt thou rule o'er the riches of budli,
shalt be made great with gold,
and be given to atli
never will i wend to a husband,
or wed the brother of queen brynhild;
naught it beseems me with the son of budli kin to bring forth,
or to live and be merry
nay,
the high chiefs reward not with hatred,
for take heed
that i was the first in this tale!
to thy heart shall it be as if both these had life,
sigurd and sigmund,
when thou hast borne sons
naught may i, grimhild,
seek after gladness,
nor deem aught hopeful of any high warrior,
since wolf
and raven were friends together,
the greedy, the cruel,
o'er great sigurd's heart-blood
of all men
that can be for the noblest of kin this king have i found,
and the foremost of all;
him shalt thou have till with eld thou art heavy
be thou ever unwed,
if thou wilt naught of him
nay, nay,
bid me not with thy words long abiding to take unto me
that balefullest kin;
this king shall bid gunnar be stung to his bane,
and shall cut the heart from out of hogni
nor shall i leave life ere the keen lord,
the eager in sword-play,
my hand shall make end of
grimhild a-weeping took up the word then,
when the sore bale she wotted awaiting her sons,
and the bane hanging over her offspring beloved
i will give thee, moreover, great lands,
many men, wineberg and valberg,
if thou wilt but have them;
hold them lifelong, and live happy,
o daughter
then him must i take from among kingly men,
ggainst my heart's desire,
from the hands of my kinsfolk;
but no joy i look to have from that lord:
scarce may my brother's bane be a shield to my sons
soon was each warrior seen on his horse,
but the gaulish women into wains were gotten;
then seven days long o'er a cold land we rode,
and for seven other clove we the sea-waves.
but with the third seven o'er dry land we wended
there the gate-wardens of the burg,
high and wide,
unlooked the barriers ere the burg-garth we rode to
atli woke me when meseemed i was full evil of heart for my kin dead slain
in such wise did the norns wake me or now.
"
fain was he to know of this ill foreshowing
that methought,
o gudrun, giuki's daughter,
that thou setst in my heart a sword wrought for guile
for fires tokening i deem it
that dreaming of iron,
but for pride
and for lust the wrath of fair women against some bale belike,
i shall burn thee for thy solace
and healing though hateful thou art
in the fair garth methought had saplings fallen e'en such as i would should have waxen ever;
uprooted were these,
and reddened with blood,
and borne to the bench,
and folk bade me eat of them
methought from my hand then went hawks a-flying lacking their meat to the land of all ill;
methought
that their hearts mingled with honey,
swollen with blood i ate amid sorrow
lo,
next two whelps from my hands i loosened,
joyless were both, and both a-howling;
and now their flesh became naught but corpses,
whereof must i eat but sore against my will
o'er the prey of the fishers will folk give doom;
from the bright white fish the heads will they take;
within a few nights, fey as they are,
a little ere day of
that draught will they eat
ne'er since lay i down,
ne'er since would i sleep, hard of heart,
in my bed:
that deed have i to do
in days long gone sent atli to gunnar a crafty one riding,
knefrud men called him;
to giuki's garth came he,
to the hall of gunnar,
to the benches gay-dight,
and the gladsome drinking
there drank the great folk gmid the guileful one's silence,
drank wine in their fair hall:
the huns' wrath they feared when knefrud cried in his cold voice,
as he sat on the high seat,
that man of the southland
atli has sent me riding swift on his errands on the bit-griping steed through dark woodways unbeaten,
to bid thee, king gunnar,
come to his fair bench with helm well-adorned,
to the house of king atli
shield shall ye have there
and spears ashen-shafted,
helms ruddy with gold,
and hosts of the huns;
saddle-gear silver gilt,
shirts red as blood,
the hedge of the warwife,
and horses bit-griping
and he saith he will give you gnitaheath widespread,
and whistling spears
and prows well-gilded,
might wealth with the stead of danpi,
and that noble wood men name the murkwood
then gunnar turned head
and spake unto hogni:
what rede from thee, high one,
since such things we hear?
no gold know i on gnitaheath,
that we for our parts have not portion as great
seven halls we have fulfilled of swords,
and hilts of gold each sword there has;
my horse is the best,
my blade is the keenest;
fair my bow o'er the bench is,
gleams my byrny with gold;
brightest helm, brightest shield,
from kiar's dwelling ere brought
better all things i have than all things of the huns
hogni said:
what mind has our sister
that a ring she hath sent us in weed of wolves clad?
bids she not to be wary?
for a wolf's hair i found the fair ring wreathed about;
wolf beset shall the way be if we wend on this errand
no sons whetted gunnar,
nor none of his kin,
nor learned men nor wise men,
nor such as were mighty.
then spake gunnar e'en as a king should speak,
glorious in mead-hall from great heart
and high
rise up now, fiornir,
forth down the benches let the gold-cups of great ones pass in hands of my good-men!
well shall we drink wine,
draughts dear to our hearts,
though the last of all feasts in our fair house this be
for the wolves shall rule o'er the wealth of the niblungs,
with the pine-woods' wardens in gunnar perish:
and the black-felled bears with fierce teeth shall bite for the glee of the dog kind,
if again comes not gunnar
then good men never shamed,
greeting aloud,
led the great king of men from the garth of his home;
and cried the fair son of hogni the king:
fare happy, o lords,
whereso your hearts lead you
then the bold knights let their bit-griping steeds wend swift o'er the fells,
tread the murk-wood unknown,
all the hunwood was shaking as the hardy ones fared there;
o'er the green meads they urged their steeds shy of the goad
then atli's land saw they;
great towers and strong,
and the bold men of bikki,
aloft on the burg:
the southland folks' hall set with benches about,
dight with bucklers well bounden,
and bright white shining shields
there drank atli, the awful hun king,
wine in his fair hall;
without were the warders,
gunnar's folk to have heed of,
lest they had fared thither with the whistling spear war to wake 'gainst the king
but first came their sister as they came to the hall,
both her brethren she met,
with beer little gladdened:
bewrayed art thou, gunnar!
what dost thou great king to deal war to the huns?
go thou swift from the hall
better, brother,
hadst thou fared here in thy byrny than with helm gaily dight looked on atli's great house:
them hadst sat then in saddle through days bright with the sun fight to awaken
and fair fields to redden
o'er the folk fate makes pale should the norn's tears have fallen,
the shield mays of the huns should have known of all sorrow;
and king atli himself to worm-close should be brought;
but now is the worm-close kept but for thee
then spake gunnar great 'mid the people:
over-late sister the niblungs to summon;
a long way to seek the helping of warriors,
the high lord unshamed,
from the hills of the rhine
seven hogni beat down with his sword sharp-grinded,
and the eighth man he thrust amidst of the fire.
ever so shall famed warrior fight with his foemen,
as hogni fought for the hand of gunnar
but on gunnar they fell,
and set him in fetters,
and bound hard
and fast that friend of burgundians;
then the warrior they asked if he would buy life,
but life with gold that king of the goths
nobly spake gunnar,
great lord of the niblungs;
hogni's bleeding heart first shall lie in mine hand,
cut from the breast of the bold-riding lord,
with bitter-sharp knife from the son of the king
with guile the great one would they beguile,
on the wailing thrall laid they hand unwares,
and cut the heart from out of hjalli,
laid it bleeding on trencher
and bare it to gunnar
here have i the heart of hjalli the trembler,
little like the heart of hogni the hardy:
as much as it trembleth laid on the trencher by the half more it trembled in the breast of him hidden
then laughed hogni when they cut the heart from him,
from the crest-smith yet quick,
little thought he to quail.
the hard acorn of thought from the high king they took,
laid it bleeding on trencher
and bare it gunnar
here have i the heart of hogni the hardy,
little like to the heart of hjalli the trembler.
howso little it quaketh laid here on the dish,
yet far less it quaked in the breast of him laid
so far mayst thou bide from men's eyen,
o atli,
as from that treasure thou shalt abide
behold in my heart is hidden for ever
that hoard of the niblungs,
now hogni is dead.
doubt threw me two ways while the twain of us lived,
but all that is gone now i live on alone
the great rhine shall rule o'er the hate-raising treasure,
that gold of the niblungs,
the seed of the gods:
in the weltering water shall
that wealth lie a-gleaming,
or it shine on the hands of the children of huns
then cried atli, king of the hun-folk,
drive forth your wains now the slave is fast bounden.
and straightly thence the bit-shaking steeds drew the hoard-warden,
the war-god to his death
atli the great king, rode upon glaum,
with shields set round about,
and sharp thorns of battle:
gudrun, bound by wedlock to these,
victory made gods of,
held back her tears as the hall she ran into
let it fare with thee, atli,
e'en after thine oaths sworn to gunnar fell often;
yea, oaths sworn of old time,
by the sun sloping southward,
by the high burg of sigry,
by the fair bed of rest,
by the red ring of ull
now a host of men cast the high king alive into a close crept o'er within with most foul worms,
fulfilled of all venom,
ready grave to dig in his doughty heart
wrathful-hearted he smote the harp with his hand,
gunnar laid there alone;
and loud rang the strings.
in such wise ever should hardy ring-scatterer keep gold from all folk in the garth of his foeman
then atli would wend about his wide land,
on his steed brazen shod,
back from the murder.
din there was in the garth,
all thronged with the horses;
high the weapon-song rose from men come from the heath
out then went gudrun,
ggainst atli returning,
with a cup gilded over,
to greet the land's ruler;
come, then, and take it,
king glad in thine hall,
from gudrun's hands,
for the hell-farers groan not
clashed the beakers of atli,
wine-laden on bench,
as in hall there a-gathered,
the huns fell a-talking,
and the long-bearded eager ones entered therein,
from a murk den new-come,
from the murder of gunnar
then hastened the sweet-faced delight of the shield-folk,
bright in the fair hall,
wine to bear to them:
the dreadful woman gave dainties withal to the lords pale with fate,
laid strange word upon atli
the hearts of thy sons hast thou eaten,
sword-dealer,
all bloody with death
and drenched with honey:
in most heavy mood brood o'er venison of men!
drink rich draughts therewith,
down the high benches send it
never callest thou now from henceforth to thy knee fair erp or fair eiril,
bright-faced with the drink;
never seest thou them now amidmost the seat,
scattering the gold,
or shafting of spears;
manes trimming duly,
or driving steeds forth
din arose from the benches,
dread song of men was there,
noise 'mid the fair hangings,
as all hun's children wept;
all saving gudrun, who never gat greeting,
for her brethren bear-hardy for her sweet sons
and bright,
the young ones,
the simple once gotten with atli
the seed of gold sowed the swan-bright woman,
rings of red gold she gave to the house-carls;
fate let she wax,
let the bright gold flow forth,
in naught spared
that woman the store-houses' wealth
atli unaware was a-weary with drink;
no weapon had he,
no heeding of gudrun-- ah,
the pity would be better,
when in soft wise they twain would full often embrace before the great lords
to the bed with sword-point blood gave she to drink with a hand fain of death,
and she let the dogs loose:
then in from the hall-door--
up waked the house-carls
hot brands she cast,
gat revenge for her brethren
to the flame gave she all who therein might be found;
fell adown the old timbers,
reeked all treasure-houses;
there the shield-mays were burnt,
their lives' span brought to naught;
in the fierce fire sank down all the stead of the budlungs
wide told of is this
ne'er sithence in the world,
thus fared bride clad in byrny for her brothers' avenging;
for behold,
this fair woman to three kings of the people,
hath brought very death or ever she died
words of strife heard i, huger than any,
woeful words spoken,
sprung from all sorrow,
when gudrun fierce-hearted with the grimmest of words whetter her sons unto the slaying
why are ye sitting here?
why sleep ye life away?
why doth it grieve you nought?
glad words to speak,
now when your sister
young of years was she
has jormunrek trodden with the treading of horses?
black horses
and white in the highway of warriors;
grey horses
that know the roads of the goths.
little like are ye grown to
that gunnar of old days!
nought are your hearts as the heart of hogni!
well would ye seek vengeance to win if your mood were in aught as the mood of my brethren,
or the hardy hearts of the kings of the huns
then spake hamdir,
the high-hearted
little didst thou praise hogni's doings,
when sigurd woke from out of sleep,
and the blue-white bed-gear upon thy bed grew red with man's blood
with the blood of thy mate
too baleful vengeance wroughtest thou for thy brethren most sore
and evil when thy sons thou slewedst,
else all we together on jormunrek had wrought sore vengeance for
that our sister
come,
bring forth quickly the hun kings' bright gear,
since thou has urged us unto the sword-thing
laughing went gudrun to the bower of good gear,
kings' crested helms from chests she drew,
and wide-wrought byrnies bore to her sons:
then on their horses load laid the heroes
then spake hamdir,
the high-hearted
never cometh again his mother to see the spear-god laid low in the land of the goths.
that one arvel mayst thou for all of us drink,
for sister swanhild, and us thy sons
greeted gudrun giuki's daughter;
sorrowing she went in the forecourt to sit,
that she might tell,
with cheeks tear-furrowed,
her weary wail in many a wise
three fires i knew, three hearths i knew,
to three husbands' houses have i been carried;
and better than all had been sigurd alone,
he whom my brethren brought to his bane
such sore grief as
that methought never should be,
yet more indeed was left for my torment then,
when the great ones gave me to atli
my fair bright boys i bade unto speech,
nor yet might i win weregild for my bale,
ere i had hewn off those niblungs' heads
to the sea-strand i went with the norns sorely wroth,
for i would thrust from me the storm of their torment;
but the high billows would not drown,
but bore me forth,
till i stepped a-land longer to live
then i went a-bed-- --ah,
better in the old days,
this was the third time!
to a king of the people;
offspring i brought forth,
props of a fair house,
props of a fair house, jonakr's fair sons
but around swanhild bond-maidens sat, her,
that of all mine most to my heart was;
such was my swanhild,
in my hall's midmost,
as is the sunbeam fair to beheld
in gold i arrayed her,
and goodly raiment,
or ever i gave her to the folk of the goths.
that was the hardest of my heavy woes,
when the bright hair,
o the bright hair of swanhild!
in the mire was trodden by the treading of horses
this was the sorest, when my love,
my sigurd,
reft of glory in his bed gat ending:
but this the grimmest when glittering worms tore their way through the heart of gunnar
but this the keenest when they cut to the quick of the hardy heart of the unfeared hogni.
of much of bale i mind me,
of many griefs i mind me;
why should i sit abiding yet more bale
and more
thy coal-black horse, o sigurd, bridle,
the swift on the highway!
o let him speed hither!
here sitteth no longer son or daughter,
more good gifts to give to gudrun
mindst thou not, sigurd,
of the speech betwixt us,
when on one bed we both sat together,
o my great king
that thou wouldst come to me e'en from the hall of hell,
i to thee from the fair earth
pile high, o earls the oaken pile,
let it be the highest
that ever queen had!
let the fire burn swift,
my breast with woe laden,
and thaw all my heart, hard,
heavy with sorrow
now may all earls be bettered in mind,
may the grief of all maidens ever be minished,
for this tale of sorrow so told to its ending
great deeds of bale in the garth began,
at the sad dawning the tide of elves' sorrow when day is a-waxing
and man's grief awaketh,
and the sorrow of each one the early day quickeneth
not now, not now, nor yesterday,
but long ago has that day worn by,
that ancientest time,
the first time to tell of, then,
whenas gudrun, born of giuki,
whetter her sons to swanhild's avenging
your sister's name was naught but swanhild,
whom jormunrek with horses has trodden!
white horses
and black on the war-beaten way,
grey horses
that go on the roads of the goths
all alone am i now as in holt is the aspen;
as the fir-tree of boughs,
so of kin am i bare;
as bare of things longed for as the willow of leaves when the bough-breaking wind the warm day endeth
few, sad, are ye left o kings of my folk!
yet alone living last shreds of my kin
ah,
naught are ye grown as
that gunnar of old days;
naught are your hearts as the heart of hogni!
well would ye seek vengeance to win if your hearts were in aught as the hearts of my brethren
then spake hamdir the high-hearted:
nought hadst thou to praise the doings of hogni,
when they woke up sigurd from out of slumber,
and in bed thou sat'st up gmid the banes-men's laughter
then when thy bed=gear, blue-white,
well woven by art of craftsmen all swam with thy king's blood;
the sigurd died,
o'er his dead corpse thou sattest,
not heeding aught gladsome,
since gunnar so willed it
great grief for atli gatst thou by erp's murder,
and the end of thine eitil,
but worse grief for thyself.
good to use sword for the slaying of others in such wise
that its edge shall not turn on ourselves
then well spake sorli from a heart full of wisdom:
no words will i make with my mother,
though both ye twain need words belike
what askest thou,
gudrun, to let thee go greeting
weep for thy brethren,
weep for thy sweet sons,
and thy nighest kinsfolk laid by the fight-side!
yea, and thou gudrun,
may'st greet for us twain sitting fey on our steeds doomed in far lands to die
from the garth forth they went with hearts full of fury,
sorli and hamdir, the sons of gudrun,
and they met on the way the wise in all wiles:
and thou little erp,
what helping from thee
he of alien womb spake out in such wise:
good help for my kin,
such as foot gives to foot,
or flesh-covered hand gives unto hand
what helping for foot that help
that foot giveth,
or for flesh-covered hand the helping of hand
then spake erp yet once again mock spake the prince as he sat on his steed:
fool's deed to show the way to a dastard!
bold beyond measure, quoth they,
"is the base-born
out from the sheath drew they the sheath-steel,
and the glaives' edges played for the pleasure of hell;
by the third part they minished the might
that they had,
their young kin they let lie a-cold on the earth
then their fur-cloaks they shook
and bound fast their swords,
in webs goodly woven those great ones were clad;
young they went o'er the fells where the dew was new-fallen swift,
on steeds of the huns,
heavy vengeance to wreak
forth stretched the ways,
and an ill way they found, yea,
their sister's son hanging slain upon tree
wolf-trees by the wind made cold at the town's westward loud with cranes' clatter
ill abiding there long
din in the king's hall of men merry with drink,
and none might hearken the horses' tramping or ever the warders their great horn winded
then men went forth to jormunrek to tell of the heeding of men under helm:
give ye good counsel!
great ones are come hither,
for the wrong of men mighty was the may to death trodden
loud jormunrek laughed,
and laid hand to his beard,
nor bade bring his byrny,
but with the wine fighting,
shook his red locks,
on his white shield sat staring,
and in his hand swung the gold cup on high
sweet sight for me those twain to set eyes on,
sorli and hamdir, here in my hall!
then with bowstrings would i bind them,
and hang the good giukings aloft on the gallows
from off the high steps,
spake the slim-fingered unto her son,
for a threat was cast forth of what ne'er should fall
shall two men alone two hundred gothfolk bind or bear down in the midst of their burg
strife and din in the hall,
cups smitten asunder men lay low in blood from the breasts of goths flowing
then spake hamdir, the high-hearted:
thou cravedst, o king,
from the coming of us,
the sons of one mother,
amidmost thine hall
look on these hands of thine,
look on these feet of thine, cast by us,
jormunrek, on to the flame
then cried aloud the high gods' kinsman bold under byrny,
roared he as bears roar;
stones to the stout ones
that the spears bite not,
nor the edges of steel,
these sons of jonakr
bale, brother,
wroughtst thou by that bag's opening,
oft from that bag rede of bale cometh!
heart hast thou, hamdir,
if thou hadst heart's wisdom great lack in a man who lacks wisdom
and lore
yes,
off were the head if erp were alive yet,
our brother the bold whom we slew by the way;
the far-famed through the world-- ah,
the fares drave me on,
and the man war made holy,
there must i slay
unmeet we should do as the doings of wolves are,
raising wrong each 'gainst other as the dogs of the norns,
the greedy ones nourished in waste steads of the world
in strong wise have we fought,
on goths' corpses we stand,
beat down by our edges,
e'en as ernes on the bough.
great fame our might winneth, die we now,
or to-morrow,
no man lives till eve whom the fates doom at morning.
at the hall's gable-end fell sorli to earth,
but hamdir lay low at the back of the houses
i have hear tell in ancient tales how a may there came to morna-land,
because no man on mould abiding for heidrik's daughter might win healing
all that heard oddrun, atil's sister,
how that the damsel had heavy sickness,
so she led from stall her bridled steed,
and on the swart one laid the saddle
she made her horse wend o'er smooth ways of earth,
until to a high-built hall she came;
then the saddle she had from the hungry horse,
and her ways wended in along the wide hall,
and this word first spake forth therewith
what is most famed, afield in hunland,
or what may be blithest in hunland
quoth the handmaid:
here lieth borgny, borne down by trouble,
thy sweet friend, o oddrun,
see to her helping
who of the lords hath laid this grief on her,
why is the anguish of borgny so weary
the handmaid said:
he is hight vilmund,
friend of hawk-bearers,
he wrapped the damsel in the warm bed-gear five winters long without her father's wotting
no more than this they spake methinks;
kind sat she down by the damsel's knee;
mightily sand oddrun,
sharp piercing songs by borgny's side
till a maid
and a boy might tread on the world's ways,
blithe babes and sweet of hogni's bane:
then the damsel forewearied the word took up,
the first word of all
that had won from her
so may help thee all helpful things,
fey and freyia, and all the fair gods,
as thou hast thrust this torment from me
yet no heart had i for thy helping,
since never wert thou worthy of helping,
but my word i held to,
that of old was spoken when the high lords dealt out the heritage,
that every soul i would ever help
right mad art thou, oddrun,
and reft of thy wits,
whereas thou speakest hard words to me thy fellow ever upon the earth as of brothers twain,
we had been born
well i mind me yet,
what thou saidst that evening,
whenas i bore forth fair drink for gunnar;
such a thing, saidst thou,
should fall out never,
for any may save for me alone
mind had the damsel of the weary day whenas the high lords dealt out the heritage,
and she sat her down, the sorrowful woman,
to tell of the bale,
and the heavy trouble
nourished was i in the hall of kings
most folk were glad
gmid the council of great ones:
in fair life lived i,
and the wealth of my father for five winters only,
while yet he had life
such were the last words
that ever he spake,
the king forewearied,
ere his ways he went;
for he bade folk give me the gold red-gleaming,
and give me in southlands to the son of grimhild
but brynhild he bade to the helm to betake her,
and said
that death-chooser she should become;
and
that no better might ever be born into the world,
if fate would not spoil it
brynhild in bower sewed at her broidery,
folk she had and fair lands about her;
earth lay a-sleeping,
slept the heavens aloft when fafnir's-bane the burg first saw
then was war waged with the welsh-wrought sword
and the burg all broken
that brynhild owned;
nor wore long space,
e'en as well might be,
ere all those wiles full well she knew
hard
and dreadful was the vengeance she drew down,
so that all we have woe enow.
through all lands of the world shall
that story fare forth how she did her to death for the death of sigurd
but therewithal gunnar the gold-scatterer did i fall to loving
and should have loved him.
rings of red gold would they give to atli,
would give to my brother things goodly
and great
yea,
fifteen steads would they give for me,
and the load of grani to have as a gift;
but then spake atli,
that such was his will,
never gift to take from the sons of giuki
but we in nowise might love withstand,
and mine head must i lay on my love,
the ring-breaker;
and many there were among my kin,
who said that they had seen us together
then atli said
that i surely never would fall to crime or shameful folly:
but now let no one for any other,
that shame deny where love has dealing
for atli sent his serving-folk wide through the murkwood proof to win of me,
and thither they came where they ne'er should have come,
where one bed we twain had dight betwixt us
to those men had we given rings of red gold,
naught to tell thereof to atli,
but straight they hastened home to the house,
and all the tale to atli told
gwhereas from gudrun well they hid it,
though better by half had she have known it
din was there to hear of the hoofs gold-shod,
when into the garth rode the sons of giuki
there from hogni the heart they cut,
but into the worm-close cast the other.
there the king, the wise-hearted,
swept his harp-strings,
for the might king had ever mind
that i to his helping soon should come
but now was i gone yet once again unto geirmund,
good feast to make;
yet had i hearing, e'en out from hlesey,
how of sore trouble the harp-strings sang
so i bade the bondmaids be ready swiftly,
for i listed to save the life of the king,
and we let our ship swim over the sound,
till atli's dwelling we saw all clearly
then came the wretch crawling out,
e'en atli's mother, all sorrow upon her!
a grave gat her sting in the heart of gunnar,
so that no helping was left for my hero
o gold-clad woman,
full oft i wonder how i my life still hold thereafter,
for methought i loved
that light in battle,
the swift with the sword, as my very self
thou hast sat
and hearkened as i have told thee of many an ill-fate,
mine
and theirs
each man liveth e'en as he may live
now hath gone forth the greeting of oddrun
